"It would help if the front girl don't just sit us down and not ask us for drinks or put us with a waitress. Instead, let us just sit here for almost an hour unattended! If it's time for you to clock out then it's not our problem. But if you're gonna seat us be more professional about it at least then leave!",3-star
"One star because that's the least amount you can leave. I understand they have dollar margaritas but they should have enough people on staff to make all the food and get people seated and fed quickly. We came in restaurant seemed slow. Hostess said 10 minute wait to let the kitchen catch up. Well by the time we where seated the lobby was packed. As soon as we sat down we each ordered a water and a margarita we were a party of two. we place our order for food. That's where things went south. We sat for 45 minutes. The table that sat after us, ate and left before our appetizer ever came. I left a $5 on the table to cover margaritas. Never going back again.",1-star
"Bad time today. Dirty windows, table sticky, handy payment/menu gadget yucky. Used my fork to enter info. Food was burned and dry. Only dark chocolate desserts. Adios.",2-star
"My second visit in the last year. Both experiences were similar: awful. Tonight, we arrived after my daughter's dance recital, so around 10pm. Not too crowded, thought it would be a quick place to grab some appetizers. NOT! Our party of 6 ordered 4 appetizers (3 of which were sample size), 2 house salads, and a kids meal. 30 minutes later, one appetizer came out, said the remainder of the food would be out in about 3 minutes. 10 minutes later, a different server brought the salads out (40 minutes after were seated, just for salads!) but we had no silverware. Another 5 minutes later, 2 more appetizers and the kids meal came out and we asked for silverware. Next time the server rolled around, we again asked for silverware, and were told ""I told her to get you some,"" referring to the hostess. He called across the restaurant to the hostess, who said she didn't have any silverware. He grumbled and went to find some. Several minutes later, our last appetizer, and silverware finally arrived. So almost a full hour before we had our entire meal and utensils to eat it with. We asked about the 50% off appetizer sign on the table and the dude actually said ""you got here after 9, and that's for after 10 on the weekends."" He did finally honor the 50% off the regular appetizer when we basically had to tell him to look at the time on our ticket. . Not completely the server's fault, but the whole experience was horrible. After two very sub-par visits, my family will NEVER go back to this location.",1-star
"Absolutely awful! Took forever to get food, food then came out cold, we asked the manager to fix tv 3 times and it never got fix! The place was dead and it was still slower than molasses.",1-star
"1.wait time was 30 minutes,then we get to table, 25 more minutes till food, then the order I had was not good, had to reorder, said it would take 10 minutes but it was longer, when they bought my food I asked for a to go box, people I was with had eaten their meal... next time I will come earlier and order different food",1-star
"The food was terrible and the service was even worse. Now I know why I don't go to Applebees. My waiter needs to be re-trained on how to do his job. He took our order and that was all he did. He never came back to clean the dirty plates from our table. The first dish I ordered was horrible upon the first bite. So I waited and waited and waited until I finally had to flag down another waitress to help me. She ordered me a new dish, only to order the wrong dish. Then I asked to speak with the manager and I watched him sit at the bar for 10 minutes doing nothing before he decided to come to my table. This was the worst restaurant experience I ever had.",1-star
"Party of six for my daughters birthday. She requested to go to Applebee's, Concord Mills. I remember now why I have not been in years. Food was OK, but service was terrible. Had to ask for everything, drink refills, napkins, no salt, pepper, or ketsup on table. Had to wave down waitress for everything. I still tipped, but regrettably. Restaurants in this country now expect you to pay their waitress wages on tips. I am OK with that if they actually earned it and not automatically expect. Last time for Applebee's.",1-star
"I've been twice now in the last couple month, and both times found the service to be good. I know what to expect in an Applebee's and that's what I go for. I sat at the tables around the bar one time and in a far back booth the second time. I much enjoyed the appetizers, the meals, and desserts. As a comment to other low star reviews. My experience is probably different because I go during non peak times. Middle of the afternoon before dinner crowd or later in the evening after the rush.",4-star
"Took my family from out of town here...never again! The food was terrible. I felt sorry for our server because she was great, but the food was nasty. It's not the cleanest place and the wait time is ridiculous. I will never eat here again.",1-star
"Prices are about what you would expect for a chain restaurant. The food is always good, and the service is okay. Not spectacular. They can be a little slow, probably die to the fact they were in the back visiting with each other instead of taking care of their customers. They are clean, but it smells musty.",5-star
"After work dinner with coworker. Ordered: burger, brewhouse chicken and chocolate lava cake Not busy @5:15pm, 5-6 tables Had to wait awhile for someone to seat us Waiter was nice but seemed distracted the whole time. Forgot my lemon and then condiments for burger. Food was hot and fresh Good experience overall.",4-star
"Big mistake to go. The total number of 1 an 2 stars is staggering. Applebee's should be ashamed of this establishment. Absolutely the filthiest place I have ever eaten at. The menus were stuck together with slopped food. The wrapped silverware had hardened food on it. The tabletop computer system had food and grease all over it (not just at our table). The food was terrible. I had the spicy chicken over mac&cheese. I do not know the name, as its is not listed on any Applebee online menu. But, it's the dish on their in-house menu. Seriously Applebee's - three frozen chicken stips dipped in some kind of spicy sauce from a jar? The mac&cheese should be just called mac, no cheese flavor what-so-ever. The server was great and service was fine. It is a pity that this place just sucks as bad as it does. Heed the warnings fellow Yelpaholics!!!!!!!",1-star
"Beware. Three words to describe my experience: crappy food, desorganized, dirty. Had to wait for what? Tables were empty and I should had seen this as a sign. No greeting no nothing. This girl came took two menus and told us we had to wait for another waiter to give here the sign to ley her know were to sit us. THE WE'RE PLENTY OF EMPTY SEATS. At last seated. No water, no silverware. The waiter kept passing by and saying she was working on it. Working on what? Melting metal in the kitchen to make our forks and spoons. Very strange. All the waiters looked very sloppy like the place, dirty and crappy. Our food came after 35 mins al together appetizer and food all cold, all the food. Our soup was frig cold. Horrible. It was a 57.00 slap on the face for the most horrible, salty, cold and disgusting food I have ever been served. The owners of this place with the sister chain Red Lobster across the street should close both down. They are both disgusting. Avoid at all costs!",1-star
Im here at applebees and the server was great but i order of their new special of 3 appetizers and one of them the brisket nacho looked like someone started eating of it. I spoke to the manager and he tells me that its the way they look..... Really!!!! I dont think.... I won't come back here,1-star
Been here a few times and everything has been pretty mediocre. Decided to try again last night and service was horrendous. Server took over 15 minutes to take our drink order and told us 3 times he'd be right with us then never stopped. Our dessert was brought to the wrong table and it took over 10 minutes for our server to notice. The food was average at best and the triple chocolate meltdown tasted like a frozen and then microwaved cake with a lot of artificial chocolate syrup. Will not be coming back to this location unfortunately.,1-star
Second visit. First time long wait but plenty of open tables. This time I was seated with no waiting. The new drinks were good but my meal took forever to arrive. No forks no knives. Meal was cold. This experience was a $80 slap in the face.,1-star
"I can't believe this place!! My husband and I went here just last Saturday night. We were looking forward to it since we have two little ones and time alone is precious. We got there and I can say that I understand it's Saturday night and about 11 so I am giving them the benefit of the doubt as to the cleanliness of the floors and stuff. We thought it was cool that they have ""tablets"" on the table now so we ordered our apps with the tablet and then the server came over. ""What y'all drinking?"" Ummmm hello. How are you? Ok so two strikes by this point. Next thing I know the server, our server, is cleaning a table next to ours and she takes a broom that has probably been in the store for at least 5 years and sweeps the table top off. There was only like two straw wrappers and maybe a lemon wedge on the table. She just took that old nasty broom and swept the table top!! CHECK PLEASE. I have worked in this business since I was 14 and even then I would have never did this. Ridiculous. Called the manager and cancelled our order. If she can do this in front of us and about 5-6 other tables there is no telling what she is doing in the back when we can't see her. NEVER going here again. Disgusting.",1-star
I always sit at the bar they take better care of you. Karl and Stevie always make sure I am taken care of. WE LOVE TO STOP IN BEFORE A MOVIE ACROSS THE STREET!! Quick in and out with a smile!,5-star
Just ate at this crappy place. Food and service sucks. Will not return to this garbage trash. The waitress don't want to work for their tips. They looked pissed because it's Saturday and they Stuck working.,1-star
"Me and my roommate have been to this applebees a few times but this last time was pretty bad, We ordered the green bean chrispers, chicken tenders plate and the oriental half salad. Green bean chrispers were very over cooked as well as the chicken tenders to were i couldn't really eat them. the waitress was nice at first and then randomly she walks by sets the check on the table like i had made her mad and walked off with out a word. Made me feel like a ""get the hell out"" from here. We WERE going to order desert but after that we decided against it. Bad service over cooked food.",2-star
"Was traveling on business from Phoenix on Oct 13th (just doing expense report today ;-). Flight was late, late hotel, etc. Was the only place open but Sarah G. was our server. She was so nice. Got the order in right away, had a great personality and kept the drinks full. Best service I've ever had at an Applebees!",5-star
This place simply doesn't cut it. The food is substandard and the service is a bunch of folks running around like they have no idea what they are doing. Go someplace else . . any place else. This truly is not good food.,1-star
"Crapplebee's is right! I joined a colleague here for a quick lunch and I'll likely not make that mistake twice. The service was minimal, the restaurant was dirty and the food was horrible. My salad was filled with wilted lettuce and my water tasted funny. I could have gotten a better salad from McDonald's at half the price. Don't waste your time.",1-star
"Pretty average trip on a Friday night. No wait which was nice, or an indicator of just okay dining? Either way...our service was good, maybe overly friendly, but better that than searching for him and he was apologetic for us having to wait for our food longer than expected for a near empty section! Our appetizer was the way over greasy would never get again Potato Twisters...basically deep fried chips with a greasy dip...just yuck! I got a cheeseburger that was a little pinker than I like it but tasty overall, he got a skillet of steak, potatoes and onions that was VERY hot and sizzling everywhere...what a mess although the flavor he said was good. Not impressed at this visit, but based on previous trips I'd give them another chance...perhaps a different location...",2-star
Meh. Just passing through and stopped for a bite..place wasn't busy on a Friday dinner service which is a bad sign. Seemed dingy/ slightly dirty. My Skinny Margarita was yummy though.,2-star
We went on Canada Day. We received excellent service and wonderful food. This place is certainly one that Canada can be proud of! Our waiter recommended the smoked haddock hash with poached eggs; I'm glad I listened to him.,5-star
"Lovely bar with good classic drinks and relaxed vibe. Hung out with smoker friends so we periodically stepped out for a cigarette (for them, not me) and the bartender was always great about keeping our bar spot and covering our drinks with a coaster. From my perspective, a nice touch of service. Saw folks ordering food that smelled good as well.",5-star
"Bar George is such a beautiful place. The servers and staff are welcome, warm and friendly and the ambiance is great. It's such a special place in downtown Montreal. I've been with friends for brunch several times and it's always delicious. However, this time we noticed that the portions have been significantly reduced. Each of dishes was delicious but smaller and some didn't come with the sides of potatoes or greens like it used to. We decided to order an extra pain perdu to share. I still love this place but I was disappointed.",4-star
"Le bar George m'avait été recommandé par un maitre d'hôtel alors que je cherchais un lieu sympa et 'différent ' pour y emmener un visiteur venu d'Europe. C'était en plein hiver et on m'avait vanté le côté chaleureux, chic et totalement approprié pour un ami venu d'Ecosse. Finalement j'y suis allée pour la première fois un dimanche de printemps, non pas pour les cocktails mais pour un brunch. Le decor est grandiose, installé dans un ancien 'gentleman's club' on sent l'histoire du lieu de par le choix des peintures accrochées au mur, les coloris choisis, les grandes cheminées bourgeoises. Le decor est joli mais manque un peu de lumière naturelle, probablement que l'hiver c'est effectivement idéal. Nous avons commandé sur le menu du brunch et tout le monde a rapidement trouvé quelque chose qui le tentait. J'ai pris une assiette dejeuner avec un morceau de boudin noir. Les portions etaient correctes, suffisantes, pas extravagantes mais le plat en soit n'avait rien d'exceptionnel. Bon, mais pas au point de me dire que je veux y retourner manger un brunch parce que finalement les assiettes étaient assez dispendieuses en comparaison d'autres places à déjeuner offrant des mets similaires. Le service était très professionnel et la salle à manger très calme, ideale pour un groupe familial ou meme un couple de visite à Montréal pour le WE. Je tenterai peut-être le bar un soir car c'est pour cela que ce lieu m'avait été recommandé initialement. Plutôt l'hiver.",4-star
"Thankfully this place was not far from our stay in Montreal. We stopped in for late night cocktails and the atmosphere was great. unique drinks and friendly staff. We came back later on in the weekend for brunch which was also very good. Avocado toast with poached eggs was everything. Get the side of Toronto bacon and soak in the salty goodness! The decor of this place is quite interesting. A very historic place ringing true to its vintage look with slightly modern pieces. Cool vibe at night, but nice for brunch. Try to go if you're in the area!",5-star
"What a beautiful place to have a nice breakfast. I went with fellow yelpers to go to Bar George. The service was amazing they have a lot of staff who always made sure that I had water, coffee and tea. As well asked if I liked the food. They made some options on the menu Vegan for me. I chose the avocado toast it had a great relish under which gave it a nice taste to it. The service was also very fast from the kitchen. They have a great Americans and with the tea they have a full pot not just a cup ! They have beautiful washrooms, parking is on the street which is free on Sundays. The only downfall with the price for a tea, coffee and two avocado toast was $30 which included the tip. It wasn't horrible but a tad high. But you get your money's worth here. Check it out for a fancy occasion.",4-star
"Great ambiance and a very nice bar. The burger was over cooked and under seasoned. Definitely will come back for cocktails, will probably skip the food!",3-star
"While vacationing here in Montreal with my boyfriend we stubbled across Bar George and figured we'd give it a try. The exterior and interior are absolutely beautiful so we were excited for the experience we were about to have. The food is fresh and each plate has such a great balance of flavors. We first came for lunch and loved it so much that we made dinner reservations for the next evening. Do yourself a favor, whether it's just to stop by for a drink or have meal, you won't regret your visit to Bar George.",5-star
"Bel endroit et beau décore à l anglaise. Très bon service, Gâteau au chocolat et son sorbet vraiment délicieux à essayer absolument",4-star
"Where do I start, Bar George gives me all the feels. It's beyond exceptional. This once home of business mogul turned exquisite boutique hotel offers fine relatively affordable dining. Also learned it's a national historic site in Montreal. It's like walking into a museum. The space is absolutely breathtaking. The 4 of us were lucky to snag a spot for brunch without a reservation on a frigid day but wouldn't chance it next time. We all loved our meals: -Full English Breakfast -Haddock Hash -Eggs Benedict -Beetroot Salad (disliked beets until this dish) Just wish we had time to return for a drink at the gorgeous bar!",5-star
"Great experience tonight with my wife. Service at the bar was impeccable, same for the dinning room. Breathtaking setting, simply gorgeous. You find yourself looking at all the different details on the walls. The food was delicious. We will without a doubt be back, this is a keeper.",5-star
"My family and I went at Bar George on Christmas Day 2017 during a vacation to Montreal. I hadn't realized that Bar George was a restaurant in a hotel until we got there but don't let that deter you. Firstly, the hotel and restaurant are beautiful. When you enter there is an ornate wooden staircase which was perfect for Christmas day post dinner pictures. The entry was also beautifully decorated for the holiday. Every staff member we interacted with was friendly and very helpful, especially regarding the menu. The food was fantastic. We all started our with cocktails that were a twist on traditional English drinks. As a gin lover I really appreciated the cocktail selection. Our server suggested the scallops with blood pudding ravioli which was delicious, I would definitely recommend this dish. Everyone in our party enjoyed what they ordered for dinner and we got three desserts to share. We got the George's mess which is their play on Eton Mess, the pumpkin pie, and the whiskey chocolate cake. I had wished the George's mess had more meringue but all the desserts were rich and delightful. I would definitely recommend Bar George to visitors of a Montreal.",5-star
"Came here for brunch and it was so wonderful! We didn't have a reservation and had no problem sitting at the bar. Great service, cool atmosphere, and awesome menu. Started with a croissant and holy moly was it good. Love the little jars of jam it is served with! Got the avo toast with poached egg and it was wonderful. Boyfriend got the omelette and he was over the moon. Highly recommend and would definitely come back.",5-star
"I had heard so much about this place that I had to try it out with my foodie friends. If you love history and visiting historical places..bar George should definately be on your list. Situated on Drummond Street, this majestic home is most certainly a site for sore eyes. A handsome smiley doorman welcomes it's guests into this beautiful stone walled mansion. Stepping into the former Mount Stephen's Club is like walking back through time. Stunning hand crafted wooden walls and marble fireplaces...makes you feel like you are in a fairy tale place. What is most awesome is that they do allow guests to visit the second floor to get a glimpse of the rest of the mansion. We went for Sunday brunch and loved the whole experience. The food itself is good but it's being in the mansion that adds to the overall experience. Will definately go back to try the 5@7 at the bar area! We went on a Sunday 10am and easily found parking on the street...no parking meter fee until 1pm on Sundays. Reservations are required.",4-star
"Everything was perfect- the old fashion, welks appetizer, cod cake with the delicious little caviar. We even made time for a rich chocolate tart with ginger sorbet. Everything was spectacular and the building itself is worth a visit. I wish I would have taken photos but I couldn't stop myself from eating enough to remember.",5-star
"Came here for brunch only, so I can't tell you about the bar or dinner. First of all, you are greeted with a gorgeous Victorian building that feels incredibly classy and elegant. However, the atmosphere was pretty laid back and unpretentious. We were seated at the bar and they also had a coat check. Service was fast and friendly! We watched them make drinks as people just sat around the oval shaped bar. Tried not to stare at the people across the table :| I got the george's full English, which reminded me of my time enjoying brunches in the UK. All the components were very well done, the beans, mushrooms, bacon, eggs, tomatoes and black pudding. Everything was seasoned perfectly. I think this was the first time I've had black pudding outside of England and honestly it was more delicious. I also got to try the haddock hash, and it was excellent as well. The prices are reasonable for a typical brunch, just a little pricier (tea was $4). It was definitely worth the experience and I'll probably go back to see what other English fare they serve up! (They have chips with curry sauce!!)",5-star
"Beautiful cuisine in a beautiful place. Luc is the best server ever. I called to ask if he could serve on my family and I because I really wanted to make an impression and he totally went beyond my expectations. The food is absolutely fantastic, as good as any 5 star restaurant in Montreal, which is saying something. I loved the boudin noir canneloni/scallop/ cauliflower dish. It was so imaginative and the flavors went together so well.",5-star
"TL;DR Beautiful room, friendly service, no vegetarian options in the Bar Bites. I was responsible for picking a spot for a 4pm bite before an event for a few members of a panel I had put together at McGill University on Ending Poverty in Canada. I picked Bar George based on the reviews, location, and the fact we were able to make a reservation at such a weird hour - I know a reservation isn't necessary at 4pm on a Tuesday, but we had a Canadian Senator coming and wanted everything locked down, if only for our own anxiety. I got there a bit before my guests and was delighted by the spectacularly beautiful room and the perfect, warm service. And then I found out that, very reasonably, we were between the lunch and dinner menus and would only be able to order from the Bar Bites. There were lots of delicious sounding options, but nothing vegetarian at all - everything had fish or meat - except for the French fries, but we needed something substantial before our event! Yikes! I asked about vegetarian options, and told the waitress my concern. She said, I think I saw on your reservation you are coming with a Senator? In that case, if she needs something that's not on the menu, we'll hook her up. Which was super nice. And I'm glad to know they can accommodate powerful people.... But but but. True class and high level hospitality is treating everyone at that high level. Anyway. I ate the curried fish on crumpets, and the cheese on the Ploughman Platter and they were totally freaking delicious. I loved the service from every single person I interacted with, and as the bar started to fill up with 5a7 crowd I got the impression this could be a really fun, classy place to come for drinks if you want to feel fabulous. And the lunch and dinner menus have salads and other vegetarian options I think, so no stress. Just a moment that left me thinking about how class can determine access to healthy, sustainable options... and a Yelp review seemed an appropriate place to share. ;)",4-star
"We decided to try the restaurant attached to our hostel for breakfast. The food was very good, but the selections are a little limited. The staff were very nice and accommodating.",5-star
"Bar George opened about four months. It used to be a private club for a while, which you can immediately see upon entering. There is a dining room and a bar downstairs, and a couple of private dining and meeting rooms in the building. There is a large bar as well, and small tables by the window in the same room as the bar. There is also a patio. We received superb, 5-star service there. Our server went over the menu and answered our questions in detail. He was knowledgeable about the food, as well as the history of the place. He also made sure that our specific requests/modifications are met exactly. The food was very good and came out very quickly. The menu was straightforward and included a few fish options. We had the atlantic mackerel and the black pudding agnolotti. The mackerel was very tender and delicious, with tasty sides. The agnolotti was very good too. We went there for lunch and didn't get drinks or desserts. I am already making plans for my next visit to try out the whiskey pudding!",4-star
"Great food and great drinks ... what else can you ask for? Located in the Le Mount Stephen hotel, this dining establishment features a dining room and a bar - both of them with very a very distinct old-world feel, given the fact they are housed within an old mansion. I had breakfast, dinner and drinks here and all of the experiences were top notch. Breakfast - the haddock hash is fantastic. I strongly recommend that Item though keep in mind it is most definitely a very heavy item, especially in the morning. I was also a fan of their coffee ... good stuff. Dinner - I opted for the cornish hen given all the rave reviews. The dish did not disappoint. The chicken was tender, well cooked and the pastry was a nice touch. The tuna crudo appetizer was also delish and flavorful.",5-star
"Absolutely stunning! Talk about one chic brunch. As you enter you will have the bar section on your left side and the dining room in front. Staff is as friendly as can be. Very suitable for business meetings or intimate dates. We had the poached eggs on avocado toasts, omelette with potatoes and mimosas on the side. You can count on me revisiting that place.",5-star
"I returned to Montreal after being away for the summer to find out that this place opened up around the corner from me. It's inside the Mount Stephen hotel, a boutique hotel in a restored historic building. I decided to stop by for breakfast. The first thing that strikes you is the space itself. The wood-panelled walls, plush carpet and hardwood floors, and marble countertops evoke the grand hotels of a century ago. You have the option of eating either in the dining room or at the bar. I chose the bar for the more open space and brighter lighting, since I was there for breakfast. The menu is simple and well-curated. Given the British pub theme, they have the usual suspects, along with the full English breakfast. I opted for the omelette forestière, with mushrooms, lardons, spinach, Emmental, and duck fat potatoes, along with a side of their breakfast sausage. I was seriously impressed with everything. The omelette was properly executed, not overcooked, and the filling was the right mix of crispy and gooey. The duck fat potatoes were excellent, with a slightly crisp, caramelized outside encasing a creamy interior. The sausages seemed house made, and had a nice herbal seasoning to them. Service-wise, business was slow when I was there, and even though the staff was taking advantage of the down time to prepare for the lunch and dinner rushes later that day, they were friendly and attentive. I'm definitely looking forward to a return visit for dinner soon.",5-star
"We were in a shopping center on Rue McGill College looking on Yelp for a place for lunch with outdoor seating nearby. This was less than a 10 minute walk away and had an interesting menu. It is located a little out of the way from the hustle of downtown, with a big shaded outdoor patio set back and above the street. Lovely spot. Two of us shared the following: a bottle of Pinot Grigio (hey, don't judge, we are on vacation after attending a conference!), the beetroot salad, tuna crudo appetizer, and the cod cake. We ended the meal with a pair of soy lattes. Everything was INCREDIBLE. It was all beautifully presented and amazingly tasty. Such great textures, colors, and flavors. Neither too heavy nor too virtuous. So many fresh herbs on everything. So creative yet restrained. Even the lattes were particularly tasty. The service was also great. Friendly and attentive. You must come here.",5-star
"My only NICE sit-down dinner while visiting Montreal for a conference was here. I was taken out by one of our previous vendors who was also at the conference to this restaurant with a few others so I dined here this past week with a small group. We had wine, appetizers, dinner, and dessert so we experienced it ALL here! I had the butler steak for my main course/dinner, it was very good, and I even got to try a few things I've never had before. For starters, when we were greeted we got a brief background of the place which was really nice and made the place and experience even more appealing. Our server had the cutest accent and we loved hearing her explain the menu options and answering our questions we had about the menu. The menus here are in French & English so again...super helpful. This place is beautiful - make sure to visit the second floor where the bathrooms are as it really looks similar to a church! Everyone is very friendly here, the place is SO nice and the food is great too. Most people were dining outside, but we dined inside as that is where the beauty of this place really is! I DO recommend dining here.",5-star
"J'ai trop trop adoré l'endroit, on se croirait dans un vieil immeuble à Londres; c'est de toute beauté! J'y suis allée pour le déjeuner et bien qu'ils soient assez traditionnels, ils sont délicieux! J'ai pris le pain doré, qui est plus un pain perdu, aux petits fruits et crème anglaise; c'était merveilleusement bon! Mon copain a pris le full english breakfast et tout était très bon! C'est pas très cher pour un déjeuner, les assiettes sont entre 12$ et 20$ ! Le café est bon, le service est excellent et je vous jure, l'endroit est fantastique!!",5-star
"WOW! The restaurant is stunning!! The food was incredible and the service was excellent. When you go (and you really should go), walk upstairs to see the old mansion.",5-star
"First of all, I love the decorations!!! It looks so fancy with the old heritage style mixing with modern twists of luxury! The service is very nice! I got a surprise dessert because I celebrated birthday day here. Talking about the food, I was slightly disappointed by the taste with $$$$ price. I ordered cream of mushroom soup as starter, it was good. The bread tasted a little bite too salty. Then I got a main dish with shrimps and fish. It was good but again a little bite too salty. The dessert consisted of a small cake and a ball of frozen yogurt. The frozen yogurt was tasty but the cake was toooooooo sweet!",4-star
"With no doubt the classiest bar in Montreal, the charm of the old place, the marvelous wood and marble work give this place a class by it's own . Everything about the bar is fantastic except the slow service,the restaurant is little disappointing, the quantities are too small, the waiters are friendly but not well trend . I guess things will get better with time",4-star
"What a beautiful house! This place is so gorgeous it makes every occasion special. I went there for lunch, had the steak, which was very good, and a great dates& whiskey pudding for dessert. Great service as well. But what makes it special really is the house interiors. It's stunning, but cozy and comfortable at the same time.",5-star
"We really enjoyed appetizers and drinks there. Staff was nice and welcoming, they had an outside patio and brought our fog and she was treated well. The food and service was great....sad it closed.",5-star
"Worst service we've ever had. We just walked out of there after sitting for 38 minutes without our order for dinner being taken. They did take our drink order and appetizer order and served those, but didn't come back until 38 minutes later. The waitress was standing at the back of the bar the entire time bull shitting with a guy that worked there. Then came and asked what we wanted to order after 38 minutes. I said nothing and I left cash on the table to pay for what we ordered and we left. We'll never go back. Place was a joke!",1-star
"My husband and I decided to try this place out for dinner. We have not yet tried this place but we were eager to do so. When you go out to eat you want to have an enjoyable meal but it was very hard to do so here. First off, We sat at the bar and heard nothing but cuss words coming from the kitchen. We all cuss...I get it but do you really need to say the ""F"" word in every single sentence. Secondly, my food had no flavor at all. I got the soup which the server talked up and I regret making that decision. Lastly, my drink was empty majority of the time. There is no professionalism here at all. I don't know about you but I do not think you should wear yoga pants to work.",1-star
We just moved across the street from the place. I was very amazed by the cool atmosphere they got going on here. We ordered a few appetizers and some beers. the prices here are really great! I ordered the prime rob sliders and a 24 oz draft beer. The food was very filling and delicious. I would definitely recommend the prime rob sliders here! The bar area looks really cool too and they have plenty of tv if you are looks for a great place to grab some drink and watch the game. I will absolutely be a frequent visitor here. Great place. Great prices. Great food.,5-star
I have been here a couple of times and I am not impressed with the service. I sat at the bar and waited for 10 minutes and nobody asked me what I wanted to drink. The bar was not crowded so I walked next door. They have potential because it looks cool and they have alot of TV's for sports but the service needs to improve. I will give it 2 stars because it looks cool otherwise it deserves a 1.,2-star
Middle of the road bar with middle of the road food. The nice thing is you can get whiskey ranging from cheap to high/middle range so you should be able to find one that suits your tastes and budget. The only problem is the bartender that helped me didn't know anything about any of them.,3-star
"We have been to Barrel Grill about 10 times now, I didn't post this until now because I wanted to see how consistent they are. The first 2 times we went we had the Ribs & we all agreed they were the best in town. The BBQ sauce is a little vinegary which we loved. Everything we ordered was hot & fresh. The Tequila Beans are out of this world, made in BBQ sauce that is a little sweet so they complimented the vinegary rib sauce well. The next time we went I had the burger & had to send it back, it was well done & I ordered it medium rare. It came back medium well this time. The meat was a thin patty, dry & very mediocre. It looked like it was steamed because it was greyish & there were no grill marks or dark edges from being cooked on a griddle. They don't tell you the size burger on the menu, I thought it was only 1/4lb when I saw it but they told me it was 1/3 lb. For the price I thought I would get a thick juicy 1/2lb burger. Okay, lesson learned, I won't ever order that again. My friend & husband ordered the Grilled Fish Sandwich & hers was thick & she liked it very much but my husbands was thin & only okay. Next time I ordered the Sloppy Joe & I'm hooked. The sauce is a little sweet & it's heaped on a soft roll. The sweet potato fries are excellent, piping hot & they sprinkle sugar cinnamon on them which I loved. I order the Sloppy Joes all the time now & they are always good but the sweet potato fries vary from piping to room temp so they are not consistent. Beans are consistently very good. The Pulled Pork Sliders were very good but the Onion Strings they came with were cold & limp. Several other visits we ordered the ribs hoping for those moist hot ribs we had on the first 2 visits but to our disappointment they have been drier & only just warm. What happened to the best ribs in town? It now seems like we are getting ribs that were made the day before. We're going to try them one more time before we give up. I so hope they go back to their high standards so I can go back to recommending them to my friends. I know you can do it because they've been excellent before. I'm rooting for you. The servers are friendly but we belong to the rewards club & never seem to get our points added on. I don't know what the problem is with that, it seems like such a simple thing to do. The ambiance is rustic western with very roomy booths & tables. The dim lighting is perfect for relaxed dining but it's not dark by any means. They have several TV's around the bar which is in the middle of the room so the games can be watched from most tables. There are 2 separate outdoor dining areas, 1 with just a few tables & one much larger. This restaurant is hit & miss food wise, I haven't tried the drinks, but I still think it's worth a try. When the food hits, it really hits!",3-star

Best chicken pot pie I ever ate! Great service...good food and reasonable prices. Husband and daughter had a burger and street tacos...yummy for all!,5-star
"I didn't want to try anything on the menu...it either had pepperjack cheese, bacon, chipotle sauce, or jalapeños. I got the house salad with chicken and was not impressed in the slightest. I'm glad I had a BOGO coupon. I tried three of the drinks (bloody mary, strawbily, and bootlegger). The bloody mary was good but on the spicy side. The other two were pretty nasty. The bartender was kind of rude at first but started being more friendly as we getting ready to leave. Service was ok. Not very attentive but oh well. I wouldn't choose to come back...just not a place I cared for but that's because I don't like the food choices they offer.",2-star
"Well, that was terrible. Wife clipped a coupon from the mail for this place. It was BOGO, so it was hard to pass it up. When we walked in we were not greeted by any hostess and the waitresses weren't sure who's turn it was. Finally seated, the waitress wondered off for a while without taking drinks orders. I had to fetch a high chair myself. When she came back, we were ready for drinks and a food order, but she ran away with only our drink order. A different waitress, who was sitting at another table (on break? She was eating with people) finally checked on us, and then our main one came back for the food order. It's been 15 minutes at this point. Someone else brings our drinks out. Waiting, waiting, and some more waiting, we haven't heard from our waitress or gotten our food. Now we are at 45 minutes. Mind you we ordered medium prime rib and a medium rare rib eye. We finally find the waitress and inquire about the food. She heads into the kitchen to check what's going on, and finds the food waiting in the window. (for how long??) The steaks were both well done, and the wife's prime rib did not come out with jus or horseradish sauce. The waitress did not check on us at all while eating. No refills, no bullsh*t ""how is everything"". Then we got the check (and applied the coupon, thankfully - saved us $22). It took another 10 minutes for her to pick up the book to swipe the card. So frustrating, and so disappointing. I know that service quality can break a restaurant, and I think it will break this one too.",1-star
"Was here for a lunch meeting. Okay place. Server was attentive and efficient. Food tasted okay, but all of us agreed it was overpriced for what was delivered. One person commented his ""Ranch Hand Steak Salad"" had very little steak and what was in the salad looked like the frozen Philly cheese steak meat you can buy at the grocery store.",2-star
"This place wasn't worthy of a rating. The waitresses seemed very flakey, I watched our drinks and food sit unattended for 5 minutes or more. The drinks were weak, the food was not only slightly over-priced but ours showed up absolutely cold! Wouldn't recommend to anyone. I would give no stars if I could.",1-star

"First time checking the place out. I'm not one who usually enjoys western themed restaurants or bars, but this one is kinda quirky and different and something about it feels inviting and fun. We stopped by for lunch on a Saturday. Not enough people here for some reason.... I was impressed with the menu- they have actual good food not just typical bar food. Their menu seems a bit unique, playing on the modern western theme they have going on with the decor. The thing that really inspired me to review this place was the quality of the food and service. Never once had to ask for a refill and our server was very attentive. Got the cowboy tacos, and they were like no tacos I'd had before. Western cowboy BBQ meets south of the border. I didn't expect the food to be so, fancy, I guess you could say? Seriously, delicious. Different, in a very good way. In fact, everything that came out of the kitchen for our lunch was cooked to perfection. Fried pickles and sweet potato fries for appetizers, and the tiny hint of cinnamon and freshness of the sweet potato fries really set them apart. And the fried pickles were still crunchy pickles, not soggy bar food style garbage. My date had the french dip and her fries were perfect and she was really pleased with the sandwich as well. Both of us walked away impressed and wanting to go back. Sure hope this place does well, because it would be a shame for the location and lack of foot traffic to result in this place not staying open long enough for me to try the other stuff they got on the menu! Great beer selection too, and the TV set up is perfect for sports fans. Definitely will be back, and highly recommend this restaurant.",5-star
"Great décor, atmosphere, food and drinks. Service was a little slow, but made up for it overall. We will definitely be going back soon.",4-star
"What I like the most about this place is the decor and vibe. It has a very nice relaxed feel and is a great place if you have kids to feed. Although, I can see it getting very ""country"" at times, when I was there if felt more like a sports themed establishment The staff was friendly, not really quick, but it looked like there was only one server at the time. The place was clean, including the bathrooms, which I tend to put very high on my rating list. Nothing really made me go ""Wow!"" at this place, but I have no complaints at the same time. They had a decent draft beer selection and lots of house cocktails that would appeal to anyone. The food was good, we just ordered a couple burgers and their queso appetizer. Burgers cooked to order, queso came with house made chips, everything was tasty and filling. If I am in the area again I would definitely go back. A worthy establishment if you are looking for a new place to go.",4-star
"This place should have been named ""The Pretentious Cowboy."" The staff and atmosphere are wonderful (if you're into the whole cowboy thing) but as much as they dress it up as fine dining, its really just a sports bar with a limited food menu with small, over-priced portions unnecessarily dressed up to appear fancier than what they really are. There is no children's menu and the drinks side of the menu has many more options than the food side of the menu. Again, this is just a sports bar. There is no explanation of what their ""barrel sauce"" is and, apparently, they put it on everything. My wife and I wanted to try something new . The place looks nice on the outside and it looks nice on the inside. We order the pretzel appetizer ($6) which comes with about 8 little buttered pretzel nuggets and a spicy nacho cheese in a ramekin. When dipping the pretzels in the cheese, its amazing to pull the pretzel out and find no cheese on it, so a scooping motion is necessary. I guess the cheese won't stick to the butter. It tasted great, but honestly, this is a bar and the warm pretzels should just be served as you're seated as a free item (like bread, you know like Outback Steakhouse, Olive Garden, Texas Roadhouse, Tarbell's, etc...) to get you thirsty and offer the dipping sauce at an additional charge. I can get three times as many pretzel nuggets just as good with cheese for the same price at any pretzel store in any shopping mall. I don't understand why they are so stingy with the portions on such a cheap item to make. If this was my place, once my customers were seated, I would serve them a tray of hot, unsalted, un-buttered, PLAIN pretzel nuggets. On the tray I would have at least 6 ramekins. One each of kosher salt, melted butter, spicy cheese, cream cheese, mustard and one with the signature 'barrel sauce.' Let the customers play with the 37+ different flavor combinations at their discretion. This gets them thirsty!! Now the drinks don't seem so over-priced. If the nuggets run out, just like with bread at any other restaurant, ask if they would like more. Some will just want to drink, others may want dinner instead. For dinner, my wife orders a salad only to find the portion is again too small and the core of the lettuce has been used. At these prices, this is unacceptable. She also orders the chicken tortilla soup and finds it tastes more like a minestrone soup. I just ordered the chicken wings appetizer, which is advertised on the menu as 'crispy'. What arrives are not crispy wings. They have a sticky sauce (not hot wings like I expected from the description on the menu) and they cost $9.50 (more than a dollar each) and are covered in scallions. Scallions? On chicken wings? To make it 'fancy' they drizzle this mustard looking sauce on the plate before placing the wings. I ask what that is, and they explain it's their 'barrel sauce' (which is pretty much on every item on the menu). It's an aioli sauce. Something I don't expect on chicken wings. There are also four sticks of celery. Hope you like that barrel sauce they drizzled on the plate before placing the food because its on your celery now, too. If I wanted the sauce on my celery, I would scrape my celery against the plate where the sauce was. Also, the celery slices were twice the size as the wings. If it's presentation we're talking about, its just bizarre. Did I order celery with a side of wings? Why not put it all in a blender and then serve it to me that way? It all ends up that way in our stomach anyway, right? Problem is, our taste buds are not in our stomach or our eyes. Our nose and tongue are what need to be pleased when we eat. From the flavor, the smell and the texture - some things are best left alone or offered as options. Why were the pretzels not already covered in cheese? Because they would be a soggy mess and maybe have too much cheese for someone's taste, or perhaps they prefer them plain. Options, get it? Let people eat the way they want to eat, NOT the way the chef prefers. The chef can make his wings any way he likes, and I'd like that same consideration without having to make a 'special request.' The service and atmosphere were both excellent, but the food just plain sucks. They take something simple, like chicken wings, burgers or grilled chicken sandwiches, dress them up on the menu with a fancy plate and ruin it by removing the simplicity and justifying a higher menu price. In a word, it's pretentious. Again, the menu was extremely limited. A cowboy place that doesn't offer t-bone steak, but does offer New York and prime rib? That's odd. Bottom line, for two sodas and those four small portioned and oddly prepared menu items was $32.86 + I left a $5 tip for the waitress (who was excellent). We both left hungry and will never return. Notice how many of the positive reviews here are referring to the alcohol. Each alcoholic drink made the way the customer wants, thousands of possible combinations. Ironic, isn't it?",1-star
"Didn't know that these guys were here and were invited by friends that live in the area. The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful inside, very upscale and new. We only sat at the bar for a short while and the place was pretty quiet for a Friday night so we really need to support this place. We need more upscale bars in this area, have not eaten here or partied here long so will have to come back soon now that I know it is here.",5-star
"Moonshine cocktails are perfect for cooling off after spicy mac, buffalo chips or southwest burger. Love the cherry limeade moonshine drink. This place is to the left of spicy, so cowboy beware! It sure could light your campfire if you get too adventurous with the spice level, but oh it's so good! We visited for my sister's birthday and it was their daughter's first trip out of the house, at 6 days old. The restaurant was slow, for a Wednesday night, so our food was hot, fresh and fast. Sis had a birthday coupon for joining their club and it was quite generous at $25 off your meal, no minimum! (just not on alcohol) Great place. Glad we went.",5-star
"This place is hands down AMAZING. Food is out of this world and clever beyond anything I would have expected. Customer service is phenomenal and everyone is so accommodating and informative. The ribs, spicy Mac and cheese, quesadilla and fried potato chips are all SO SO good.",5-star
"This was our first time having dinner here. the atmosphere is pleasant with an old country feel. My wife's mojitio as a bit different without the mint but she really enjoyed it. I appreciated the variety of beers since my favorite beers are craft beers. Our waitress was great. She was efficient without being over bearing. She was also very pleasant and seemed to interested in providing us a great experience. Of course we went there for the food. I had the French dip with the tequila beans. Great sandwich. It was well proportioned, hot from the grill and delicious. My wife had the chicken posse salad. Again it was a really good salad with a generous portion. This will definitely be one of our favorite places on the west side",5-star
"I just went in with my wife and we had a great meal. The food was hot and tasty, the service was really friendly and fast and the place is really cool! They have a neat outdoor patio and this giant bar when you go in. They also have really comfy booths too. There are TVs to watch the sports but they are not on with sound so they don't bother you during conversation. This was a great place to go and have some fun.",5-star
"Great atmosphere. Country themed. Live music. Rustic. Good for large or small parties. Full bar. Attractive waitresses. Great food at reasonable prices. Had the pretzel/cheese appetizer. A little small, but just enough to keep us full until the entrees arrived. I had prime rib. A very large cut with minimal waste for only $19! Unbelievable! Wife had blackened ribeye. Delish and plenty to take home in a doggie bag. Kid had chicken salad. Spicy with tortilla chips. They serve moonshine! Yes! Call Tim and Tickle, someone is selling on their route! Server was quick, attentive and not hard on the eyes. In fact, the wait staff was made up of all beautiful people. Live band, country. A bit loud, but they were in tune and on pitch unlike most local live bands. And they took breaks to allow dinner conversation.",5-star
Went there for a family gathering (10 of us) on a Monday evening. The place had about 4 other tables going. For not being busy the food took way to long to reach the table. Nothing outstanding about the food and asked for a well done burger and it had to go back as was pink. Will probably not go back as you can get a better burger for a better price elsewhere.,2-star
"The restaurant has a really cool vibe. Definitely country. There is a cool giant wagon wheel hanging above the dining room. I had the chicken pot pie, amazing crust and delicious filling. Jesse had the beer can chicken, super moist and came with 2 sides. The tequila beans were beyond anything I've ever tasted. Fast and friendly, our server was great. Restrooms were impeccable and have cool metal work. They have a nice outdoor patio. I'm happy to see a new business in the area. Wonderful!",5-star
I had a great lunch with my 3 month old the other day the staff was spectacular and I was accommodated with a booth for the car seat. I ordered the Barrel Burger which was very tasty seasoned well but my bun was falling apart but I managed to get it all down the pickle was good too. I was super impressed with the design of the place with an open patio area cool furniture namely the cowhide bar stools. There was country music playing just loud enough to not wake a baby and I can't wait to go back for drinks and dinner with my wife maybe before the baseball game on St Patty's Day. It would be on my list to hit for drinks and a date for sure! Who ever designed this place gets 5 stars! I'll be back with friends and family.,4-star
"AWFUL! Group of 4 for dinner & drinks. Of the 4 different entrees ordered all were lacking in flavor. All the food appears to be pre made, nothing fresh. In fact our server told us that the chicken is pre seasoned so no option for altering. the server also said that when a table near us who received their food way before us even though we ordered before they ever sat down by 40 minutes that they got their food first because what they ordered was pre cooked so just needed to be preheated! No manager doing rounds to the tables. It seemed odd since this is a brand new place. If you like fresh food this is not the place to go. Ended up at humble pie for dessert in order to have something tasty to eat that night.",1-star
It's refreshing to see a unique concept on the west side of town. The owner hit the nail on the head describing the concept as a MODERN saloon. Western with clean edges and updated takes on classic dishes. Was also pleasantly surprised by their signature cocktails and draft beer selection. Will definitely be dinning here again.,5-star
"I'm always here at Blaqcat and I absolutely love the hookah. The guys that work here are always coming up with new mixes and it's the best hookah I've ever smoked.

"Came in after a date night with my girlfriend. Smooth hookah, attentive and kind staff. We were served by Trey.

Been to many hookah lounges; by far the best one I've been to, and I will definitely be back! It was very relaxing, played r&b 90% of the time (aka our favorite genre).

"We found this place on Google with no expectations whatsoever and it was awesome.

"We were hookah lounge hopping in our 5 day stay in Las Vegas. We came across this place, taking a lyft all the way from the strip to Blaqcat was a pretty lengthy ride. I think our lyft trip costed the same amount as our hookah. The locals were telling us that this area was a sketch neighborhood but we decided to see for ourselves. Walking in the place was pretty nice, clean, the place was narrow but it was a good size lounge. We ordered something we usually order from back home but ordered it with milk in the base for the first time. The guy kept pushing us to get a fruit bowl like he was trying to force it upon us. But we didn't budge, it was like $40 or so. Minor issues. There was a lot of other booths to sit in but he asked us to sit at the same table with another couple. At first we were like ..eh but we ended up mingling with them and they were very informative. I gave it a 5 star based on smoke quality and service.",5-star
Money's worth!!! Hookah bowl lasts!! No need for constant refills like other places. Great customer service they are always checking on you. Amazing workers amazing hookahs!!!! +++++,5-star
"This is by far one of my favorite hookah lounges. The music was perfect, the atmosphere was chill, and it was perfect for just sitting and having a nice conversation with friends. We bought the pineapple head hookah with blue mist and a little mint flavored tobacco. It was perfect. We were there for 2 hours and the hookah was the best we had ever experience. It never got harsh and the flavor remained the entire time we were there. The staff was great at helping us too. We were three woman who don't know much about hookah and they kept changing the coals and ashing them for us. Super attentive. We also ordered tea! We were in heaven the tea was delicious and so fancy with the pretty tea cups and sugar, honey and mint leaves. Super nice. Highly recommend the jasmine pearl. The hookah lounge closes at 2am but they don't kick you out. They have you settle your bill and let you leave when you are ready. I LOVED that! Although we did leave 15 minutes after 2am because we didn't want to be those assholes who keep them too long past closing. It was still super refreshing to not be rushed out due to closing. We will be back!",5-star
"I've been a regular since the opening of this lounge. I'm sure none of you want to read a wall of text so here's the sweet and simple. Blaqcat has a pro-social atmosphere with low edm and reggae music playing all the time. With a large variety of flavors and house mixes, you'll never have an issue with finding something to your taste. A great assortment of beverages from iced teas to flowering teas that take your breath away in presentation and flavor. The customer service is top notch. Knowledgeable, friendly, caring and attentive. The best part of this longue to wrap it all up is whether you're a frequent customer or just stopping by to check it out. You're going to feel welcomed and at home with the amount of service and care they provide to every individual customer. So come on by and give it try.",5-star
"These guys are really top-notch. They have great service. Great presentation of their offerings. I got Moroccan mint and it came with nice combination of elegant teapot, mint leaves, sugar, honey. They understand hookah very well. It never burns and becomes harsh. They have an excellent service, so much so that, they come and arranges the coals in every 5 minutes. Nice ambiance and clean environment. Recommended.",5-star
"Blaqcat definitely has some upsides and downsides. The staff is super nice and they are very attentive. They come by often enough to check your coals, but usually just leave you alone. During the week it is super chill, but I went on a weekend one time and the music was so loud (and terrible) you couldn't hear the person sitting next to you even if you were screaming. I'm not sure if that was a special event, or something they do every weekend. The atmosphere is very nice, but the benches on many of the booths are so high that you feel more like you are waiting for the bus, than hanging out smoking hookah. Last time I was there, I asked to move to another booth with lower seats, and they told us it was reserved. We were in there 2+ hours and there was only one other booth occupied the entire time so I'm not sure what they were waiting for. The tea selection is great, but I feel like they've changed the recipes a bit. The ""Buried Treasure"" iced tea used to be my favorite, but the last few times I ordered it, it tasted like they dumped in a ton of strawberry syrup instead of using fresh berries the way they used to. All in all, its not a bad place to hang out sometimes, but its not usually my first pick.",3-star
Super awesome place. Always willing to mix up something special for you. I believe his name is Mark. He's great and makes good conversation as well as always making great recommendations. He's also super nice when it comes to splitting the bill up. There's usually 5+ in my group. The music can be a little wack some night so I recommend sitting outside and bringing a little portable speaker. They don't mind. Definitely going back soon. It's my friends' and I go to spot. :) Also. Keep your receipts! There's a discount when yiu bring it in as well as a check in discount. I don't think they can be combined though.,5-star
Great consistent service and people there don't just look at you as just a transaction in their business. Hookah is great,5-star
Fantastic customer service. The flavors are delicious and you can mix! It's definitely more of a lounge than a club which I like.,5-star
I like this place the staff were friendly and everyone in the lounge minded their own business while it was my first time. I ordered straight guava since i thought i could handle it by moderate experience with friends at parties but turns out i made it to the bathroom and ended up throwing up ROFL. Worth it even though i was light headed and feel asleep in the lounge awhile.,5-star
"HIGHLY recommend I always come here for the tea because I love hookah & tea . I got the vanilla truffle tea and we got two hookahs- sex on the beach & strawberry daiquiri . They were fairly busy for a friday night but not slammed. The hookah took a little bit to come out but the service was great! Both employees were very apologetic about the wait which was no problem because we were just chatting and sipping on our drinks. When my hot tea came out I asked if they had honey, but they said they were out. Bummed, I decided to go to the Wal-Mart next door to get some (im picky - I know). I asked if it was okay if I brought some in and the same guy (assuming a manager or something) insisted he would get me some. He left the store, came back with some, and put in the little dish for me. AMAZING service . He went so ABOVE & BEYOND it was great . The hookah tasted great, I got my tea, & they delivered the greatest service I've ever seen . Seriously my go to lounge .",5-star
"Been going for awhile now,and I think it's finally time I wrote this. This place is absolutely my favorite spot in town to smoke a bowl or two an relax for the night. The staff here has always been great and the owner is always here and he's amazing. The bowls here last longer than anything I was ever used to when I came in my first time. The selection of drinks and teas is what always keeps me coming back on top of it. The prices are great and the atmosphere is amazing. If you're not looking the silly party atmosphere like some lounges try to have and more about the hookah and the overall experience then this is the place for you. They specialize in fruit bowls and use some fruit I had never even considered as an option but it always comes out perfectly. They'll treat you like it's an upper class restaurant and sit and talk with you whenever they can. You couldn't ask for anywhere better to spend your night smoking. For all csn students who love your hookah they're right by the Charleston campus so it couldn't be a better place to spend the long time between classes that happens from time to time",5-star

Great shisha, excellent service and awesome environment. We ordered: Fumari Chocolate Mint 5/5 Fumari Gummi Bear + Lemon Mint 5/5 Overall one of the best spots to chill at or get some work done. I will be returning.",5-star
Love this place. It's a lounge and not a club so that's one of the things that I like most about it. The staff is legit and takes care of you. Prices are fair and selection is got what it takes to have a good session. I have all my own gear but when I wanna chill. I drop In here all and its way more relaxing . I go once a week,5-star
"This lounge is not your average Las Vegas hookah lounge as they do not serve alcohol here. Instead, they serve amazing tea and passion juices which compliment the flavors of the hookah. The atmosphere restores the meaning of ""lounge"" and is perfect for small gatherings or even informal meetings. The prices are reasonable and the flavors last for quite some time. The hookahs were iced and VERY clean - they don't leave you with that dirty, burned, sick feeling afterwards. The staff is attentive and friendly to customers. I felt very welcomed and comfortable during my entire visit and will definitely return here again.",5-star
"I'm so surprised this place doesn't get better reviews. I've been here many times before and it has always been an awesome experience. The food is DELICIOUS... truffle fries, OMG! I am now what I call a cheating vegan/pescatarian. Basically, I eat mostly vegan except I do eat seafood and I don't require something be perfectly vegan to eat it. If it has a little milk or cheese in it, that's fine. Took my daughter here for lunch a few days ago and she got a fantastic burger w/the truffle fries. I got the calamari. I tasted her burger and OMG... so good!!! Everything was absolutely fantastic. Our server was very attentive, friendly, and accommodating. And, this has always been my experience in the past. I love the build your own burger option. I'm pretty sure if you wanted to be completely vegan, you could order the veggie burger on a lettuce wrap. Anyway, such a great place, great people, great food. Don't let the negative reviews turn you away. I've lived in Cave Creek for 16 years and this is one of my favorite restaurants. And, I have many friends who also agree. My only wish is that they would stay open later, at least on weekends.",5-star
"I called to ask if they had gluten free buns and the man who answered the phone had an Australian accent, he told me he didn't know if they had gluten free vegan buns, so I asked him if he could ask someone because he never offered to ask someone else to find out. When I asked him to ask someone else he said sarcastically"" who do you want me to ask"" I said ""idk just someone "". How would I know? I don't work there. Then he yelled ""DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH""? Then he hung up. It was very disrespectful, and I am never going to come back. I just wanted to know because I have allergies and apparently that's to much to ask for at blu burger.",1-star
"Very disappointing. For the prices they charge the quality of burgers is sad. Over cooked, unseasoned burger on a stale bun for $20 are you kidding me? Servers tried to accommodate but almost like they know the food is not good. I will not be going back.",2-star
"Overpriced Mediocrity: location will keep this place is business through the summer but only because the options in this area are so very few. The menu is not worth the bold pricing. Save the money and drive 4 miles south on Scottsdale Rd to Cold Beer & Cheese Burgers. Setting: Blue paint everywhere but like a frat house basement rather than a swanky destination. Service: Inexperienced wait staff and clearly the kitchen as well. Drinks/Food: here's the real killer.... wife and I each spent considerable time reviewing the menu. The cocktails are uninspiring in both their descriptions and ingredients. The beer list is a tour of boredom. Nothing in the drink category would make Blu a destination. In an era of spectacular microbrews and small-batch distilleries, here is a great opportunity to shine with very little effort. The appetizers are the standard boring fare. So standard that you may simply skip them. Fries, truffle fries and onion rings are all the quality of the free lunch program at an elementary school cafeteria. I say ""free lunch"" because they are so bad that all four tables in the restaurant that day at lunch loudly complained and had them taken off the bill!!! My wife ordered a medium rare beef burger off their specialty menu. Her burger was called the Habenero Burger and while it had the requisite heat, the medium rare order was delivered as a chalk-like well-done. Two bites and the burger was left on the plate to finish it ongoing death. I, myself, ordered a Build-your-own burger. Trying to emulate the Pittsburger from CBCB, I ordered a beef patty (med-rare) with slaw and a fried egg on an onion bun. The patty was again well-done and very dry, the slaw lacks depth of flavor and the classic runny egg was like a flattened version of a hard-boiled. The bun was fresh. I thought this may be a one-off bad day but reading other reviews it is becoming quite clear that if the owners take any pride in food, they will tear the whole menu down, hire a chef and brighten the space. Staff is in desperate need of training, particularly efficiency. This stretch of N. Scottsdale Rd is prime for a reliable sit down lunch spot. It is surrounded by a great deal of expendable income but this restaurant in its current state is a far second to even the quick food court at the Target next door.",1-star
"I'm actually not sure how this restaurant is still in business. Other than no other restaurant with burgers being nearby. We started with the Hummus and Pita plate. The waitress brought out dirty appetizer plates, one with hot sauce stuck to it, and the other had guacamole stuck on it. How do you not consciously notice such disgusting dirty plates?? They obviously do not care. I ordered a salad which wasn't good. I ordered what they call ""Parmesan Truffle fries"" on their menu, and anyone who has ever had these fries anywhere else has a conception on how these fries SHOULD look and taste. The hostess came out with fries that looked like they were from an Ore-Ida frozen bag with a small amount of shredded Parmesan cheese on top. She didn't even bring ketchup, and ran away before I could ask for some. They also tasted the same as how I have described them. My child's Penne Alfredo was gross as well. I didn't even have a chance to say anything because the waitress wasn't even attentive, and the hostess was serving us. I was also charged for an Iced tea that we never ordered, but I didn't dispute it because I wanted out of there quickly. They really need to get it together, or they will go out of business or be shut down by the health department. Anyone would hope they do before somebody gets food poisoning. Unacceptable and nasty!!",1-star

"I have a lot of food allergies and this place is the worst. The waitress was really rude and snotty when I asked her questions about food preparation/ingredients. I seemed to be bothering her. I try to be extra nice to people because I know I'm a unique case, but they were very unprofessional about it. No one at this restaurant, including the chef, could answer my questions about what their food is made of. It is infuriating and humiliating to have to cancel orders and walk out because I can't risk getting sick- a restaurant should know what they're serving and be able to let you know what their food consists of. Don't recommend this place if you are gluten free, or if you have any other food sensitivities.",1-star

"Very bad experience! Server was insulting from the moment she dragged her big fat behind up to the front door to open it - five minutes late on a Sunday morning. Right then, I knew things weren't going to be good. A month or two ago, some new, older friends from church took me there for lunch after service. We got there in separate cars, and walked up to the door at 11:30 on-the-dot. The door still had the ""Closed"" sign hanging. mmmm . . . ok. Maybe they're running a little late this morning? The wife of the couple that took me, however, couldn't take the heat very well, as it pounds down on the front of this crap-hole, full-on at this point of the day. She went back to the minimal shade provided by the car to wait. Finally, at 11:35, big girl shows up at the front door (btw, no name tag, and no ""Hi, I'm so-in-so, and I'll be serving you today,"" so this is the best, most accurate way I can describe her). The insulting, degrading service began there. Seeing this elderly, frail couple standing outside in the blinding, hot sun, she took her dear old time opening the door. Instead of immediately opening the door with an apology and smile, she thought it better to change the ""Closed"" sign to ""Open,"" and a couple other things. I can't remember right at this moment; maybe it was opening the blinds or something? I forget - but I can tell you it took her a good 45-60 seconds to get around to opening the door. Oh, and worse yet, this bitch didn't even hold the door for us!!!!! (Maybe that's what I was thinking of?) She unlocked it, turned around, and walked away. WE WERE SHOCKED! BUT, my friends were paying - I was their guest - they had been here before (as had I), so I had to go along w/the flow. These are very good, tolerant and forgiving Christians, so we stayed. Had it been me (not nearly as good and tolerant a Christian:), I would have given her an attitude adjustment forthwith! FOOD & SERVICE: Things didn't get any better once seated. Guess who our server was?! YUP! She was horrible! Even my new friends said something about her BAD attitude! She never ONCE smiled, acted even remotely kind or like she gave a rat's ass once throughout the entire meal. I can best sum up her service this way: she did everything but roll her eyes (in front of us, anyway). The burgers/meal was ""mehhhhhh,"" at best. The beef was tasteless and from experience, I could tell they were (trying to) cover that fact up with the plethora of dressings that made up the better part of the burger and bun, itself! And when considering the OUTRAGEOUS PRICES, it sucked! I wasn't paying, so I didn't see the grand total, but judging by what we each ordered (no alcohol), I'm sure it wasn't cheap! When I go out to eat and am picking up the tab and have great service, I don't hesitate to make the tip AT LEAST 20%, and often round that UP to $10, $20, etc. If the service is so-so and the food's good, it's 15%. If the service sucks, the server gets little or nothing. If the service is really bad, as it was in this instance, I purposely leave only two-cents (yes, two pennies) and in a very obvious place, to show my utter distain for the server. In this case, just based on the way we were treated by this woman at the front door, I wouldn't have even sat down. SAVE YOUR MONEY! Don't waste your time here. Judging on how empty this place was when we left over 1.5 hours later, my guess is that they'll soon be forced to shut down just like their Shea Street/Scottsdale location had to. Note also that I said I had been there before. Both times within the past year, both times in the middle of Happy Hour, both times 75% empty.",1-star

I ate mine, it was good and the 11 year old asked me because it was so rare if it was safe to eat? I said we could send it back but she said no. We saved about 20% of her patty and asked the wait person to show the kitchen what came out as medium and stated we were just giving feedback not looking for anything else. The wait person came back and said the chief said that is their medium. I'm telling you if you asked 10 people 80% would say rare, the others medium rare. NO one would say it was medium. Very disappointed they did not own up to there mistake. Other than this issue the meal and service was a 4 star.",2-star

I love how you can make your own burger and put whatever you want on it, the choices are endless and are great for picky eaters!

I definitely recommend anyone who wants a good burger to come here!",5-star
"Ate here for lunch today with my family and I must say, it was pretty darn good. We ordered the Angus beef burgers. The beef was great quality and cooked perfectly medium rare. I liked how you could pick everything you wanted on it. The fries were crisp and tasty. I ordered a salad instead of fries with my burger, and it was fairly large. I can't say I loved the ranch dressing, though. Yes, it's a tad pricy for burgers, but not ridiculous. They were really good burgers too. We'll definitely be back.",4-star

"This place had potential. Who doesn't like burgers, especially build your own burgers?! So I start this place at a full five stars. But it fell flat for me. First of all, this place is literally in like the middle of nowhere. 35-40 minutes from Chandler without traffic. So that was lame. But anyways! I ordered a Build-My-Own burger and asked for it medium and it was cooked well done and wasn't juicy at all. Which sucks cuz I want meat! Nice juicy man meat! Not hard charred burnt meat. But I digress, I had a burned up piece of meat with some nice mushrooms and onions but due to the burned meat and the overall lacklusterness of the burger, I shall subtract a star. Four stars so far. However! The sweet potato fries with Herb Sauce was delish! I wish I had a whole plate of that instead. So I shall add a star. Five stars now. I also can't go without mentioning a drink. I had here signature Blu-Martinin. Which was indigestable. It was so nasty and strong and just awful. I told the waitress about it and she just offered to put ice cubes in it??? That did nothing but add ice cubes. Minus a star. Four stars. Ambiance was...interesting. The place was small and it was cold, and dark. Very vampire-esque. And if you're a lady don't even try to walk to the bathroom by yourself. It's like walking down rape alley - there are no lights anywhere! Also the place like doubled as a gelato shop. So it's just odd going for a gourmet American burger and then being slapped in the face with an enormous selection of Gelato. I believe Hubert Keller would scoff. Minus a star. Three stars. Would I go back? Hell no. The drive isn't worth the sub par food. It's just a small little shop with mediocre food and bad drinks. So I'll opt out. And just because I left feeling so disappointed I'm dropping a star. Overall - 2 stars.",2-star
"Maybe this place should change their name to Big Burger because these suckers are huge! And oh, so tasty. The boyfriend, his mom and I went here on a Saturday afternoon. The place is not very big and was about half full but we managed to snag a booth. We all ordered burgers of course although they do offer other sandwiches and salads. We all chose the build your own burger option, boyfriend and I going with grass-fed and mom going for the bison. I went pretty standard on mine - American cheese, lettuce, tomato, ketchup and mayo on a white bun. Like I said earlier the burger is huge and they do not skimp on cheese. (yay!) I cut it in half and dove in. The meat was cooked really well, just a little pink and was super cheesy. The bun was fresh too. From the first bite to the last it was a wonderful, messy, delicious experience. Boyfriend and mom agreed between burger-filled slurps and chomps. One thing to note, these burgers ain't cheap. They start at around $11 and go up from there depending on what kind of meat and topping you choose. But it does include a side, so there's that. I would definitely go back here to stuff my face with a sloppy burger and fries again. Yum.",4-star

"Stopped in around 230pm so it wasn't very crowded and it ensured fast and friendly service. I don't eat most meat so I settled for a build my own salmon burger. My delightful server asked if I wanted cheese and I said I didn't know about cheese on fish. She said have crumbled goat cheese. So I did. Came out quick and hot on ciabatta bread. It was delicious ...I should have tried the fries. The cole slaw was okay but i like mine with more kick. Had a cold Fat Tire and it was great combo I had planned to try the veggie burger but she said they were good but frozen andhad to be fried to keep them together so I wasn't real keen on frozen. I'm sure it's better than the Boca Burgers in my freezer, but with everything else tasting so good my only suggestions to do what Cold Beer and Cheeseburger does just south on Scottsdale and make the fresh each day. This is going to be a regular spot for me and friends. If you are up this way you must try it. And don't for get the delicious goat cheese on your burger. Great service",4-star
"Had lunch here yesterday to fuel up before a grocery shopping excursion (need a full belly otherwise to many snack foods end up in the cart!). This was my first time although my wife had eaten at another of this chains locations once several months ago. Since it was close to the store I was game to give it a try. Decor is clean and certainly ""blue"". We were sat right away at one of the last 2 tables and were promptly greeted by our waiter. The iced tea we ordered was delivered quickly and we each ordered a build your own burger. My wife is a vegetarian and ordered the veggie burger and paired it with the zucchini fries. I had a basic Angus beef burger with slaw. The service was prompt (the restaurant is so small that it is hard to be forgotten), teas were refilled and even though the place was full we received our food in 15 minutes. My burger was cooked perfectly, a moist and juicy medium and my wife just raved about the zucchini fries which were crispy and you could actually task the zucchini inside and not just the batter. All in all a nice place to grab a quick bite to eat if you are hungry and come across one of their locations. Pricing is moderate to the low compared to other ""gourmet"" burger joints in the valley - $36 tab for 2 (with tip) - a decent value in my book for good food and nice service.",4-star
"Had my reservations about this place from reading the other reviews. My wife and I decided to dine here on a Saturday evening about 6:00 pm. We walked right up and were seated promptly. We were greeted within 45 seconds and had drinks shortly after. My wife went w one of their signature burgers, habanero, w zucchini fries and I built my own w sweet potato fries. Food was delivered within 15 minutes and was delicious. That's when this place started to get busy and service went downhill. I understand that the servers don't want to be over staffed bc it impacts their take home pay, but when customers don't return bc of poor service it should be a concern. Once we paid, our check was dropped off by another waiter who simply placed it on our table and kept walking. No thank you or anything. In the end it's just a burger and I will choose to dine someplace that appreciates my business. You're not my boy Blu!!!",3-star
"On the plus side.... I love being able to fully customize my burger. You are given options for each piece - type of meat (regular beef, kobe, buffalo, turkey, veg, etc.), buns (whole wheat, kaiser roll, etc.), cheese (blue, cheddar, swiss, etc.) veggie toppings and condiments. One never knows day to day what one would crave, so it's great to be able to mix it up. On the downside... Every time I have ordered a burger medium rare, it has ALWAYS been undercooked. Not a problem if I'm in the restaurant, but I often grab takeout, so once it's home and covered in my nifty personalized toppings, I'm kinda stuck with a rare burger. And when I say rare, I mean you can see the mushy fibers of the meat/fat. I do love the flavors of the burgers and if sweet potato fries is your thing, theirs are very good (the thin cut, skin-on kind). I think if you order your burger one temp up from what you want, you can have a really great meal. And though the burgers are pricier than places like Red Robin, it's a much bigger burger, so the value is there.",3-star
"I'm hoping that someone at the Health Department reads this and is as alarmed as I am about what I witnessed at BluBurger last night. I was sitting at the bar and ordered a cheeseburger with no add-ons - so no lettuce, tomato, any of that jazz. Literally within three minutes of placing my order the bartender put a plate in front of me. Surprised by the speed but not thinking much of it I ate a couple of sweet potato fries, then noticed that ""my"" burger was awfully dressed up. I lifted the bun up with fingers I just wiped my runny nose with (I know, I'm totally gross but I thought it was my food) and saw that it was not what I ordered. At the very same time the bartender came hurrying back, saying she accidentally gave me someone else's order. As she whisked it away I explained that she'd have to make it over again because I already touched it and I have a cold. She kind of laughed and brought the plate back to the kitchen window. I watched while the cook did nothing more than put the big toothpick back into to bun and sent the contaminated plate out to the unsuspecting diner. I don't know if the bartender didn't tell the cook what I said about already touching it and having a cold, or if neither of them cared. What I do know, however, is that is really, really gross, and if I knew that I was eating someone else's snot germs I'd barf. So if you ate at BluBurger last night and you develop a cold this weekend, now you know why.",1-star
"By far the best veggie sandwich I've had in a long time! My boyfriend got a burger and I was able to stick to vegetarian fare. The service was decent. We were one of the only tables in the restaurant. The lighting was kind of overwhelming but, I think it was just the time of day paired with the blue walls. I felt like I needed my sunglasses. The blue moon my boyfriend ordered seemed a little flat but overall, we would go back.",3-star
"BluBurger is a standby of mine whenever I make it out to the Target close by. I've been several times and the food has consistently been good. Love the California burger and sweet potato fries. Pretty much know I can get a good burger here, when the mood arises. I went yesterday with my son and the server mentioned they had a kids meal. I was really happy, but also disappointed that in all my other visits (always with my son), no other server mentioned that. The only squabble I had (specifically from yesterday, because I was STARVING), was that I waited almost 5 minutes for a greet. It was 2p, there were only maybe 4 other tables in the restaurant. Two or three servers looked at us, but 5 minutes for a greet? That's not acceptable. Won't stop me from going back, but still not so good.",4-star
"Where's the beer? Not a huge burger fan - but Boyfriend is and I was craving a cold beer... We agreed on Blu Burger as we lack restaurant options north of Deer Valley Road and East of Cave Creek Road. We had been before and had a great meal. Considering I don't love burgers - I was exceptionally happy with my meal. BUT - here is the issue - I didn't pay much attention to the beer menu the first time - I wasn't impressed but settled on a Corona. But last night - craving a nice cold beer after a long week at work - I scanned the beer menu - well - it took 2 seconds to scan and all I saw were the likes of Bud Light, Miller Light, Coors Light, Amstel Light, Corona etc... So help me understand - Fancy Burger Joint serving up College Beer? Fat Tire and Stella on tap just don't cut it for me. I politely asked (did not complain - simply inquired) the manager what the deal was and he showed me the beer list saying they had plenty of beers. He also told me that they were more of an upscale burger / food place. Well no sh*t - I knew that already - so I just want to know why they think it is OK to serve (in my opinion) - crappy beer (again - just my opinion). Why not get some great micro-brews on tap - and maybe a couple of the 'upscale' beers in a bottle - a Newcastle would have been fabulous last night. They have a decent wine selection as well as liquor - but to me - wine and burgers just don't mix - while a beer and a burger would have been so savory last night. BUT - I won't knock the food - the burgers and the options are great - the fries are excellent and we had excellent service.",3-star

"ROACHES!!!! So disgusting! My workmates and I decided to try Boca Taqueria, Mesa location, since it was close by. The atmosphere was adorable and the food smelled great. We decided to sit at a couple of center tables put together. About five minutes after receiving our food, baby German cockroaches began crawling all over the table. My coworker screamed so loud that the women sitting nearby were startled and asked what we'd seen. I went up to the register to speak with a cashier and what I assumed was a manager. Just after telling them about what we'd just witnessed, the manager said, ""We figured after hearing your friend (my coworker squealing). We have the owner on the phone now."" I said, ""Oh, so you know about this?"" The manager said, ""Yeah, but that's why the owner is on the phone."" Still no apologies at this point. I must've looked shocked, and the cashier, a nice young lady, said, ""Those tables were outside, so we're thinking that's where they came from. We're just as disgusted. We've been dealing with this for two months."" I walked away in absolute disgust. Baby roaches don't stay babies for long. If any were attached to those tables while outside two months ago, they had already set up camp and had been laying eggs in the restaurant. At this point, we were moving from those tables to two booths. As my friend and I were moving our meals over, another manager came by to proclaim his apologies and to say that the owner has had someone in to take care of this and doesn't know why it's still happening.... And they are STILL serving food?!!!! Shortly after moving to the booths, a baby roach crawled out of my salad. I almost started crying and took the salad to the manager we had just spoken to and said he needed to take it from me. He pretended like it couldn't be happening. After sometime (we assumed he was on the phone with the owner who advised him to deny deny deny), he came back to the table and completely retracted what he had said before. ""This has never happened here before, and we don't know why it's happening."" He was nice enough to give us our money back, but that could never makeup for one of us or any other guest getting sick. Also, lying is such an unappealing quality in someone who is serving you food... Making a call to health services over this.",1-star

"I've been to Boca (formerly Tia Rosa) many times. Love their food! Although, my order tonight (6/21/17) was underwhelming. I got the low carb plate with steak and extra guacamole and sour cream, came out to $20! I've gotten this before though and I knew good food comes with a price though or else I would have just gone to Filibertos. I got home, opened it up, and... the ""steak"" looked like shredded beef. I know their shredded beef, this was definitely shredded beef. Looked and tasted like shredded beef. The pieces would fall apart if I rubbed it between fingers. I called my friend who use to work their and sent him a picture, he confirmed... shredded beef. Not to mention, I've gotten this exact same plate before, the meat was steak, not shredded beef. I paid an extra $3 or $4 for the steak so I drove all the way back their. Showed the manager (not Clay) and cooks, they said it was the steak just cut up. I insisted it wasn't and showed how easily it broke up. The cook then went and got a piece of shredded beef and showed me, which looked like what I had, just cut up but he insisted they were different. They then went on to say that the beef and steak are the same, they just don't shred the steak like they do with the beef... NO, steak and beef are not the same in the culinary world. I paid extra for a better part of the beef, hence the name STEAK. This was definitely a chuck roast (shoulder) part of the cow, slowly cooked, meat falls apart easily. Finally, they played the guilt game and said if I wanted to they would grill a new steak and not cut it up like they did with the one in my hand. I declined because of the way they were talking to me, like I didn't know what steak is. I disappointing went home knowing I got scammed $3 or $4 for steak. It was almost 9 and they were to close soon so I know the cooks just didn't want to cook the steak. For now on I guess I will just have to go to Filibertos for my low carb, affordable, options. Leave a comment on whether that looks like steak or shredded beef!",1-star
"This review is for the taco truck. I drove into my apartment after work and saw a big orange food truck, yay no cooking! I have to say this was way better then I expect from a food truck. My husband had beef tacos and we shared the beef nachos. Best nachos I have had in a long time! Everything was really fresh and the shredded beef was tender and very lean.

"This bars good, maybe great. It perfectly fits a gap in the Old Town scene that was left when The Lodge shut down. It's outdoors, the food is good, they have games if that's your thing, and they draw a good crowd. But they have this terrible bouncer. He's a tall guy, probably 300 pounds, he's not really muscular, has a buzzed head of hair, darker complexion. Friday night 3/23 I had a bad experience. I was just waiting in line to get in, but when I showed him my ID with my old picture from 2002, he said I should ""cut my hair like in my ID picture, it looks stupid now"". I appreciate a good joke, but this wasn't a joke. He was just taking a dig at me. Then... once I meet up with my buddies on the inside, my other friend (who has a shaved head and is slightly balding) tells me that the same bouncer gave him a hard time too... for no reason mind you. just said: ""Looks like you're balding"" I'm not going back there. I'm going to suggest to my friends that they not go back there. I'm going to suggest that strangers not go there either. Just because of one bad attitude. Yelp isn't just a place for people to complain, look at my reviews, there are plenty of positive ones. But I think it's a great place for businesses to look at what's working and what's not. This guy is definitely not.",1-star

"This bar is quickly becoming one of my favorite spots in Scottsdale. They have plenty of seating and multiple screens for the game. They have one huge projector screen in the middle of the patio. Did I say patio? They have a large outdoor patio with plenty of seating for everyone. Come, relax, have a drink, and enjoys your friends.",5-star
Decent bar in old town. They have a really awesome outdoor patio and usually have pretty good bands playing. Great prices on booze. The reason for the 3 stars are the incredibly disrespectful staff. Doormen have a Napoleon complex and are very confrontational. They will snap on you for breathing wrong. Just because you have a hat that says security on it does not give you the right to berate paying customers. This place should take a good hard look at how their employees represent their business. What I saw and experienced was disgusting. I really enjoy coming to this place but as long as a few select members of the current staff continue to work there I may be taking my business elsewhere.,3-star
"I'm going to preface this by saying that I hardly ever leave reviews. Tonight, I walked over to Boondocks with my buddy to catch the late NFL game. As soon as I walked in the door, the ""manager"" immediately says ""you're not getting in here."" I did a double-take and said huh, why? He proceeds to state that I look drunk, that my eyes looked red. (I'm a type 1 diabetic that hasn't had a drink in 4.5 years) I tell him that I'm not and that I had just finished a cigar with my friend. He says ""your not getting in here."" Again, I tell him that I'm a type 1 diabetic and I show him my Continuous Glucose monitor attached to my stomach and my Insulin. Around this time, my buddy says hey this is discrimination. The ""manager"" says to my buddy ""wait, before you get all huffy and puffy and ask for the manager....I am the manager!"" This goes back and forth for a minute until he says he'll let me in. But then he says ""if I see a beer in your hand, your gone."" I didn't get his name, but he worked tonight, Sunday night 11/6/2017. Once we got in the rest of the staff were awesome...just this guy who was apparently on a power-trip.",1-star

"My first time coming into this place and was pleasantly surprised! There was only one bartender (Tim) and it was pretty busy, nonetheless he was on it for just about everything. Drinks, food and atmosphere was great, only problem was the misers made it cold once the sun went down but that's not a big problem. I love the patio and now open it is. I ordered the bbq bacon burger and I was completely satisfied with the burger itself and the crispy perfect fries it came with. I will certainly return, especially if I'm day drinking! 5/5",5-star
"(Read in a shatter voice) Star date 12162016: a cool cloudy night with a windy breeze created the perfect atmospheric conditions for a great night. There was live music by a band from a foreign town and beers from mystic town. They had an excellent experience created for the patrons to enjoy. I find, what they call ""cornhole,"" to be one of the lost amusing games. They throw corn-filled bags onto a board and someone declares victory... astonishing.

We found ourselves playing some rousing games of pool while kicking back that Irish goodness they call Guinness. As we were about to embark on our journey, we were halted by an icy atmosphere that halted our ships from travel. Nevertheless, Boondocks indeed took care of us.

"The absolute worst service I have ever received in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. We waited over an HOUR for 3 sandwiches while the bar was fairly empty. Our server had no idea what was going on and told us it was her 2nd day but they just put her out by herself so in addition to the hour wait for food we waited 40 minutes for our checks and check out. They didn't take off a discount card we had and then the manager came back proudly saying he discounted our champagne for us- looked at the bill and his ""discount"" was the price of the days special!! What a joke. Please save yourself from having an awful day/night and go somewhere else",1-star
"Go to Boondocks if you want the absolute worst service you can possibly experience in a bar. We ordered nachos and pepperoni bites, the nachos took over an hour and came out stone cold, the bites took another half hour and were black and burned to a crisp. We literally had to lean over the bar and stare into the bartenders faces to get their attention. I've been here a few times and the service has always been lousy. The staff just wanders around staring off into space or chatting with each other - it's hard to get a drink even when the place is mostly empty. I've given it several chances because the atmosphere, patio, etc. are all really great, but I won't be going back.",1-star
"Boondocks is my ""go to"" bar in old town Scottsdale. The alcohol is cheaper than the other bars in the area and the food is very good as well. It has a great atmosphere (both indoors and outdoors) where you can play cornhole, ping pong, pool, various arcade games, and jenga. It's the perfect place to watch sports or just hang out. I was just there for the Super Bowl and it was packed. You have to stop here if you're looking for a cool bar that isn't your typical old town nightclub. Ask for Joe the bartender, he will take care of you and makes great drinks.",5-star

"Boondocks is the most amazing place in Scottsdale. I had my engagement party there this past weekend and it was the best time I've had in a long time in Scottsdale. Scottsdale tends to be snobby and over the top, but Boondocks was the exact opposite. Scottsdale has needed a place like Boondocks for years and finally it has arrived. Everyone was friendly, atmosphere was open with plenty of room to spread out and enjoy your own space, food was fantastic with a wide variety and the best part was the live band and games. We played bags, beer pong, table tennis and dances the night away. We are from Chicago and all bars are like this out there so it was nice to see something in Scottsdale that has the same vibe as our home sweet home Chicago! Thank you Boondocks for a night of wonderful memories!",5-star
This is by far the coolest and most original bar in town. The management especially Matt Olms make this my bar of choice and the only establishment I will frequent in old town.

"Best place in Old Town for playing games on an outdoor patio. Staff is fun and there is plenty of room for bringing a big group. That said I've come to watch a game by myself and ended up making several friends at the bar. It has that local hangout kind of vibe that makes it my go to spot for a casual beer.The crowd is pretty mixed and friendly. Wednesday night is county night and a lot of fun. There is live music occasionally with pretty talented musicians. Somehow ended up here on a Saturday night and the ENTIRE bar was singing Michael Jackson songs for some sort of retro night while dancing. Two other times a random pub crawl rolled through in costumes. Seems to always be something fun going on here. Oh, the Pork Belly BLT is AWESOME. Staff is great and seem to know everyone too.",5-star

"Sadly this bar is very typical of Scottsdale bars that charge high end prices for food but come up very short. Come in for Monday Football with a friend. Waitress came over within 3 minutes and suggested that it was Cheesy Monday, half off Mac n Cheese or Cheese Bites. Call me simple, who doesn't like a Mac N Cheese plate? Order a Orange Blossom, which tasted flat? I took a couple of more sips and yes indeed it was flat, waitress comes over after 10 minutes, and I tell her that the beer tastes flat, she tells me beer can't go flat? Having thrown a couple of keggers, I know otherwise. She tells me that she is going to ask them to change the keg (yeah right). I got another Orange Blossom and it still tastes flat. I deal with it. Waiting for the Mac N Cheese, I notice that the place isn't that bad of a place to hang out, it could be maybe be a decent alternative to The Lodge, this was before my next experience. So the Mac N Cheese comes out, The first thing I noticed is that it comes in 2 small skillets, 1 bowl would make clean up a lot easier, but hey I like simple things. My friend and I notice that there is no real cheese sauce on the Mac N Cheese, so we take a bite to see if maybe it is at the bottom. Nope, there is a slim sauce on this so called ""Mac N Cheese"". We ask the waitress, if we ordered Mac N Cheese or some noodles? She tells us, ""we""ll you don't want too much sauce it will ruin it"". Nope its already ruined. As the menu stated ""Mac N Cheese with cheese sauce, bacon and bread crumbs"" The bacon was fake and bacon that comes in a shaker, which I didn't think they made anymore. She brought out some more sauce, which made it ok. How can you ruin Mac n Cheese? Ask Boondocks because they butchered it. Upon getting our bill, I noticed that the waitress charged us $1.00 for the cheese sauce. Classy move Boondocks. I wont be coming back here, ever again. The menu prices don't justify the food they serve you, I can imagine how the $18 ribs are? No Thanks....",1-star
"Casual sports bar with large connected patio. It's a nice place to get away from the fancier Scottsdale bars. Lots of places to sit or stand, both inside and out. It's easy to see the remnant layout from Spanish Fly, the previous bar that featured a large pool in the middle. I like what they did with the space - added more tables, an area for cornhole bean bag toss, and ping pong. The bar is large and wraps around with plenty of TV's. I've been here a couple times. The first was to watch a boxing match. It doesn't take long to have a drink in your hand and the standing room comfortably affords crowds. The second time was on a Saturday morning. A couple guys wanted to have a few rounds of beers and play bags. It was warm out, so despite the outdoor fans and portable AC units, we built up a sweat. We ordered a bucket of Coors light. You get 5 cans for $16. Later we ordered some Corona's. Again, we got cans. I'm not complaining, but glass bottles would have been a nicer touch. Sometime, I will try the food. My friends' tacos looked pretty good, and they've got a nice selection, though you can't mix and match. Overall, Boondocks is an average watering hole, with nothing particularly memorable about it. But that's not a bad thing! What it offers is a relaxed patio to grab a beer and watch some sports, preferably on a nice day. And sometimes, that's exactly what you're looking for.",3-star
"Great concept. Have gone to Boondocks for over 10 times now. Love that you can go inside when you want (summer) and outside for 9 1/2 months out of the year. Also its a place that gives you option for activities. Pool, Ping Ping, Sack Toss etc.... And provides the room to do it. Food is a little pricing for a lunch menu but worth it. Beers on tap are interesting. Mixing it up. Really cool. Service has been great. No complaints at all. Dog friendly is cool. They take care of the patrons with dogs with ice and water. Nice touch. I read some of the other reviews. Some of them either sound like they are auditioning for Secret Shoppers/Diners or they work for competing venues in Old Town. Thanks Boondocks (for being so new but a refreshing change to what else is out there).",4-star
"Typical Scottsdale douche bag central. Bartenders are douches and slouches. Extremely slow and inattentive. The wait for a beer, even on slow days is painful. Crowd is of course 'look at me' lame. Beers are poured short and are expensive. Patio is ok but will get WAY too hot in summer unless they shade it somehow. Very limited tap beers. All other beers are in a can, which is supposedly for a charity thing but realistically probably getting dumped out back. Yes there is Cornhole/bags but the bags are so poorly made they leak their pellets all over the patio. Hard to see this place making it in it's current form. Unlike what Yelp reviewer Pepper said, this is NOT a ""sports bar"" let alone a ""modern"" one.",1-star

The other girl behind the bar was working so hard, very friendly and seemed very customer oriented.

It was quite busy for the game, and very sad to see that only one waitress took her job seriously and put all customers first.",1-star
"Well, we all know BP, and how people like to hang out there after work for beer, snacks and to watch sports. So I am not sure what made us decide to go there tonight for dinner, maybe the close proximity to the liquor store across the parking lot. We shared the cactus cut potatoes with cactus dip. Not too fussy about this thing for $10.79. Mains: Spicy Perogy pizza and Chicken Parmesan. Perogy pizza: she had tasted this pizza before and liked it but said that this one was nothing like she remembered. Sadly it was an overcooked yeasty dry crust, covered with congealed dry cheese. The dollop of sour cream was ok though, rating: 1.5 out of 5. Chicken Parmesan: The chicken breast was a bit watery and the crust was too dry and hard from the deep frying process. The portion size of the garlic mashed potatoes was small, and it did not taste like garlic at all, I guess I got the regular mashed with some pieces of red onions in it... The seasonal veggies consisted of broccoli, cauliflower, carrot slices and red onions, they were bland. Hey Boston Pizza people, vegetables can have a taste, just give it a chance!! Rating: 2 out of 5. The service tonight was nothing special, the appetizer came quick, but it took some time to get the main course and the food was prepared and plated without attention to detail. I guess it is just what it is... We gave it an overall rating of two. This place is just not the type of restaurant or food we like, and the visit tonight reminded us of that. We will go back to our ""usual"" family owned spots around town and enjoy their hand crafted foods.",2-star
"We ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad and the Pesto Chicken Pasta. The salad came underdressed, so I had to ask for more dressing. Having waited 10 minutes and tried to get the evasive server's attention, she finally but begrudgingly brought me my dressing. Having dressed the salad, it was pretty good. Not the best I've had, but decent for the fact that it's a premium fast food. My gf enjoyed the pasta, but it wasn't the best. She also found a couple uncooked pieces. I found the sauce to be extremely bland. About a year ago I had the gluten free pasta here and it tasted like cardboard cooked in sauté de cardboard. Extremely bland and a terrible gluten free pasta. Overall, not too good. Lots could be better, I wouldn't come back.",1-star

"i would like to think that such a big named franchise would have a standard for being the face of the company. went here with a group of friends. a dozen or so. this place drives me up a wall, as the service from the whole business we recieved was the second WORST service ive ever gotten in my life. the restaurant was over heated, as i was sweating the whole time i was in this establishment, we had a very quiet server, who forgot some of our drinks(mine). the kitchen didn't deliver all of the food on time either, as my best friends dinner was a good 15 minutes after majority of us got food, and one other friend didn't get a salad after 30 minutes later, which ended up being cancelled. refills for drinks were very sparse, no apologies were given on any level. when it was time for the dessert menus to come out, only one menu was given to an entire table of 12...? WHY?! the bathroom is an amazing display of not giving a care in the world...the toliet seat had some orangish redish dried something on it, the lock was busted on the partition, the back-up lock for the partition, when you slide the bolt in place, it was short of the latch, and the spacing between the door. finally to make matters worse, every point the partition was anchored, was barely grasped onto the wall... its really ridiculous when this is a representation of the company that is known for being better then most. very dissatisfied and will never go to a boston pizza ever again if i could give a zero or a negative number...it would get my lowest vote possible.",1-star
"Verbal assurance from staff that they have Halal Chicken options. Ordered take out pizza from this location.

I've come here many times over the years most regularly for geeks who drink trivia. While I love the trivia and the atmosphere (although don't like that the trivia master is in a separate room which makes it hard to hear) I have been underwhelmed by both the food and the service the last few times I've come. I know trivia is a busier time but we often went long stretches of time with empty beer glasses and no check in. The cheese curds are way too greasy and the torts I got last time was only ok. It was also very spicy but gave no indication! The fries are interesting. I like the seasoning but it was way too thick on many of the fries. I'm sure I'll be back for trivia but will probably just stick to drinks in the future.,2-star

"To be honest, bordering on a one after my last few visits. Shortly after my previous update the menu was overhauled and the staff appears to have been purged. The one item I enjoyed from the previous iteration had been wiped out, but that's life. My boyfriend and I decided to split the Fireside Nacho Fries shortly after the switch, and while they sounded good on paper (thick home fries, chopped pork, cheese, salsa, sour cream) it was one of the worst things I've been served in Madison. The fries were mushy, the pork stringy and flavorless, and everything was wet due to the watery tomatoes and salsa. After that I gave up on food, which is fine. I come for the trivia and to occasionally enjoy an adult beverage, and since trivia doesn't start until 8:30 I have more than enough time to make dinner before. Speaking of adult beverages, on my most recent trivia trip I saw they had Surly Horchata on nitro. It sounded delicious and I was psyched to try it. The only problem is that in the two and half hours I was there I got no service. Someone stopped by to drop off a plate that my friend ordered from the bar when he arrived before us, but after setting it down they turned and left immediately. No one came to get us water, no one came so we could order drinks, and the empty plate sat there untouched for about two hours on the edge of the table. There were two servers in the dining room and both acted like our table didn't exist. I could have gotten up and ordered from the bar, but literally every other table was getting table service and I am hopelessly optimistic and thought surely, if nothing else, someone would come to clear the dirty plate. I was wrong. Two and a half hours of sitting there without being checked on once is inexcusable. The only reason I'm giving them a two instead of a one is that they do have a solid tap list and it feels disingenuous to continue to show up weekly while saying ""methinks not."" The great trivia host will keep me coming back, but if he ever moves on I will, too.",2-star
"The Buck & Badger won me over a bit since their breading on chicken is gluten free (that's a rarity for us GF people). The service was okay, but a bit over priced. I got a salad, and there wasn't much chicken on it. My husband got their wings, and said they were some of the worst he ever had. The rest of the table seemed to enjoy their meal. We went at lunch in the summer so we easily grabbed a table outside. It was difficult to get more drinks, condiments and the check. We would have appreciated more attentive service.",3-star
"Four years later and new management...OMG. This place is awful. First of all they revamped the menu and got rid of the tots. What? Yeah. The service at this place has always been underwhelming. I thought my review would be repetitive if I updated with that. So I was going to take a pass on it until the menu came out. The new menu is a joke. I am rarely so scathing but avoid this place at all costs. After sitting at a table, ordering my drink and looking at the menu (about twenty minutes), I am informed that there is no turkey and chicken drumsticks. What? Is that not something you say immediately. So my server, who also knows nothing about beer, tells me they can just put ham or chicken breasts in everything. Great? I ordered the Turkey melt with a house salad. In their defense, the menu did say turkey and cheese on bread. However, in my head I thought I would get a tomato, a sauce, something....NOPE. I have had better meals at diners by the side of the highway. I literally received a a sandwich with a dry chicken breast and a piece of cheddar. This cheddar wasn't even melted. So I dipped it into the ranch on my salad. In fact, I took the greens from my salad and put them on my sandwich. The salad was ok. Kind of boring, really big carrot chunks. In Madison, a side salad is never an afterthought. Alchemy? Their side salad is always a main event. This place? Completely forgettable. I rarely say this - but I will never, ever, ever, be going back again. What a pity they took away such a good menu. Oh, also this was at 6pm, the dinner rush on a Saturday night. Maybe you can't bring back the tots, but for the love of food, please make a good sandwich. You have too much competition on this strip that if you serve awful food, you will not make it. As I ate, I longing looked at all the happy people walking by with their Ian's pizza.",1-star
Overpriced and underwhelming food! I ordered a large chili and they brought me out an 8oz cup for $7.70. I asked to make sure this was their large and the server assured me that it was. What is there small? A shooter glass full? Unbelievable! I can't believe anybody would eat here.,1-star
"Slow, confused service and expensive, below average food make this place a 2 star if not 1. Once again Yelpers got it mostly right. We would have avoided but we were going to a show with a 5 year old and American food with a more casual atmosphere was what we needed. Wish I would've taken the time to find something better. The food is expensive for what it is. The burger was just a plain burger and you had to add everything for extra if you wanted more toppings, .75 for cheese and $1.75 for things like bacon, mushrooms, sauteed onions, fried egg, etc. $1.75?!? That's crazy expensive, especially for the quality. When we got there the place was empty except for 2 tables. It took forever to get water and even longer to get drinks we ordered. My dad's first beer was ice cold, which is not how it should be served if you know anything about beer. We had to flag down the waitress for a second round. The place started to fill up, several tables that sat after us were able to order their food before us. We finally were able to order food. All of our order were wrong to some extent. I had cheese on my burger, it was fine I didn't originally order with cheese because of the ridiculous up charge. I barely got any mushrooms. I was asked how I wanted my burger cooked, not sure why since it was a puney frozen 1/4th lbs thing. My dad's burger had tomato when he asked for no tomato. My son who has dairy allergy received a burger with a bun spread with butter. We had just asked for a burger no bun. This seemed confusing to the waitress, she kept asking ""so no bun?"" The salad was plentiful but way too much diced tomatoes and the ranch dressing was translucent and gelatin like. Looking around all other tables were waiting around, looking for their server trying to order their food, get water, or pretty much any type of service. The server was nice but not competent and my old fashioned was decent, the only reason I'm giving it a 2 not a 1. But we will definitely not be back here.",2-star

Well- every place screws up. Sometimes monumentally. Out mid afternoon snack break during the Art Fair On The Square turned into a dilemma. No dilemma on tip- just whether we stay to pay. Slowwwwwww. Everything. First bad experience here- but extraordinarily bad- if kitchen staff calls in sick on a nice Saturday- I would call it quitting or ask for a doctors note to explain the tragedy. Bottle flue or sunshine love aren't suckness- but will cost this place my business. I bet a rain day would have cured the illness- or a policy that requires appropriate request off policy.,1-star
"The waiter came to take our order outside and I'm pretty positive that he was stoned out of his mind. He kept repeating himself and asked us what we wanted to drink multiple times. when we said we needed a few minutes to order food, but asked to start with bloody Mary's, the dude never came back. I'm still in utter disbelief that we just sat there for over twenty minutes. Ended up walking out..,",1-star
"Tried this place when it first opened and thought it was nothing spectacular. Food was dry, plain, bland, etc. Portions were small considering the price. Service was alright, again nothing spectacular. My initial thought was ""they're new, they're working out the kinks"" or something along those lines. I also figured since it was on State they would bring a good product to the table being such a prime location so I, for some reason, elected to give it two more tries. The second and third times mimicked the first time. I won't be back.",1-star
"Went to Buck and Badger for dinner last night before a comedy club show. We got there an hour before the show (the comedy club is a minute walk from Buck and Badger). We were seated pretty quickly. The server was very friendly and took our order quickly. Here's where it gets bad. Two of us ordered pasta dishes. The server comes back to inform us that they are out of pasta. We are pretty laid back and understand it was probably a busy for day for them, so we order something else. We waited over 30 minutes for our food to arrive and they only had 2/4 of our orders correct. We were already running low on time and now we had to wait for the correct food. They came back, and had one of the orders wrong AGAIN. Since we didn't have enough time, we decided not to say anything. Here comes the worst part. One of my friends ordered a steak. We are both 90-95% sure that what she received was hamburger shaped like a steak. It was not fleshy, but rather had the texture of ground beef. This was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant and we won't be going back.",1-star
"""Disappointing"" summarizes our visit to B&B this evening. The food was mediocre at best. My brother-in-law ordered the treetop steak - and received literally just a burger patty. It was hilarious and sad. The only saving grace was Leslie, our excellent server. She's the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars. What happened, guys?? You used to be good! The menu is half the size it used to be, and nothing was good. I'm sad.",2-star
"1 star actually equals zero stars. By far the worst service, kitchen staff I have ever witnessed. 45 minutes later our burgers arrived. Ordered 5 burgers, not one burger was correct. Three separate trips back to the kitchen to fix the burgers and guess what? Still wrong on everyone one!!! Paid for the drinks we had and walked out. I'm sorry but how hard is it to dress a burger reading off of a order slip???!? Ou and by the way there were still empty tables so no excuse for being ""busy""! Will not ever ever go back.",1-star
"I'm more confused than anything. I used to walk by this place all the time and see people eating these huge plates of what looked like pretty heavy foods--big platters heaped with sides. I also see reviews that mentioning things that at least sound interesting: boar burgers, whitefish hoagies, etc. When I went today I was kind of surprised to see an incredibly limited and boring menu--some burgers, chicken sandwiches, fried apps-- and food that was served in red plastic baskets with no sides or garnishes (or the pickle listed on the menu). The food was ok. We ordered burgers and chicken sandwiches. None were very large or particularly tasty; sautéed mushrooms were burnt and the ""large"" side of fries was ludicrously undersized and overpriced. What we ate would be decent in a dive bar, but seemed underwhelming in a place where they clearly spent so much money and effort on decor. Service was friendly but extremely slow. Despite the overpriced fries, the total damage ($37 for four) was pretty low. I can't imagine going back, though, nor can I understand the appeal of this place.",2-star
"Hoped this place would have been better but alas it was a pretty big let down. Service was on the awful side. I got my beer but the wife didn't get her drink until we asked twice. They said they would comp it but then, they didn't. Ordered a small onion ring but charged us for a large. The onion rings were brought out 10 minutes before our sandwiches arrived. It just went on and on. And the food was just meh. Nothing to write home about.",2-star
"Food took a very long time to come out. Friend and I ordered burgers. Orders were mixed up and the fries were cold. The burgers themselves were dry, not much flavor, with soggy piece of lettuce. Order a burger at five guys that's way better and cheaper. Told us they normally serve cookies but the chef burnt them all... Service was okay. Will not be coming back.",1-star
"I've given this place three chances in the past two years, and every time was a complete disappointment. The first visit was with my wife and a friend, and probably the ""best"" experience of the three. Several beers listed were out of rotation, and still being listed on the specials board outside. The service was overall slow and inattentive. I ordered the brat, instead I was given a french dip. I figured I wouldn't be back anyways, so I left a decent tip and went on my way. Second visit is similar with the service being even slower. We were at the restaurant for around two and a half hours. Our table's drinks were brought out when we were just about done with the appetizer. The fries that came with my meal seemed as though they had been sitting in a fridge for several days. At the end, there was no acknowledgement of error, so I left a lesser tip. Our third and final time was a spectacle of failure. It took 15 minutes for a server to recognize our presence. Another 15 minutes pass and my wife's drink arrives, but my drink is not on tap anymore. My next drink choice does not arrive till after the appetizer again. Upon receiving our food, (burgers both ordered medium) mine is served well done, and my wife's is mostly medium rare, with a small section appearing like it hadn't touched the grill. Shortly after our food came, we find that the table behind us, who had been there since we sat down, still had not received their orders. After three experiences like mine, I will never recommend this place to anyone. Quite frankly, it's impressive that they're still drawing a crowd of any sort.",1-star
"Food here is always excellent. Place is very up northy. The Boar Burger is definitely one of the best out there, and the apple cider glazed carrots are delicious. If you're up for something a bit different, definitely try this place!",4-star
"I stopped by the Buck and Badger after work for a quick beer and an appetizer while waiting for friends. Their beer selection was pretty good. They had the beer that I prefer, so that was good. But the reason for my review is the bartender was a bit of a dick. He was wearing a cap bro-style (on backwards) and had this phony superior air about him. It was off-putting. Some people sat next to me and their first three beer requests the B & B did not have. The bartender gave them some pretty strong 'tude and said ""You guys have to broaden your horizons."" They handled it well but seemed slightly put off by it. The menu options were limited and the prices pretty high. They wanted $14 for their fish-fry special. In Madison, a good fish-fry is usually $10. Overall not impressed.",2-star
"I love coming here when it's warm and drinking a Bloody Mary or 5 and people-watching. It's within eyeshot of capital square, and when the farmer's market is going on you have a GREAT view of everything and everyone. Service is good, apps are good, and the Bloodies come with the most charming little beer chasers. Come on a Saturday in the spring, sit outside, get day-drunk, and watch the Madisonians do their thang.",4-star
"I came here with a group of friends. The menu is small. I ordered a cheeseburger with fries. The burger was a bit small (too much bun) and was rather pink, although I had ordered it medium-well. The menu also stated that the sandwiches came with a side and a pickle, but the pickle turned out to be two small pickle slices. The fries were good, nothing special. My friends ordered the mac n cheese bake, which they seemed to enjoy, and a BLT, which seemed to be just ok. The service wasn't great. The waitress brought the wrong meal to one of us. I have a feeling she was new though, as she was flustered by some of our questions about menu/payment, so perhaps it isn't totally fair. I have heard this place is fun for trivia, but I probably wouldn't return for anything but to check that event out.",2-star
"I should've listened to Emigh C. below. The food was expensive, not impressive at all and just sat in my stomach. There are lots of amazing and better priced restaurants nearby (Ian's for example)!",1-star
"Three friends and I were looking for a restaurant on State Street for dinner before a show at the Overture Center. One friend said he was really craving a burger, so when we came upon the Buck & Badger, we decided to give it a try. We figured if they were able to afford to be so close to the Capitol, they had to be pretty decent. Unfortunately, this was not the case. We were seated right away and were served drinks pretty quickly, which seemed promising, although the specialty Jack Daniels cocktails two of us ordered came in disappointingly small glasses. But then after we ordered our food we waited. And waited and waited. It was at least a half an hour before our food arrived, so even though we had initially given ourselves well over an hour to eat before our show started, we felt rushed once we finally got our food. The food itself was okay, but nothing that wowed us. I chose not to spend the extra $3 for a side because I thought the coleslaw that came with my sandwich would be good enough -- who seriously wants to spend $3 for a side order of fries? -- but the coleslaw was absolutely tasteless. The menu describes it as ""sweet mustard cole slaw"" but it was basically wet cabbage. My chicken sandwich, while nice and hot, was also pretty bland. The sweet potato chip breading didn't have as much flavor as I'd anticipated, and they really skimped on the chipotle mayo. My friends enjoyed their burgers but didn't seem overly impressed, and the long wait certainly didn't help. If I'd had a chance to read reviews before we went there, I don't think we would have gone in the first place knowing that we had a show to get to and others have experienced the same very long wait we did. Also, other reviewers mentioned that they received complimentary chocolate chip cookies. We didn't get any, so either they no longer do this, or they were forgotten since we had to flag down our waitress just to pay the bill so we could get to our show on time. Either way, this was a disappointing dining experience, and with so many other restaurants on State Street, I wouldn't bother with a second visit to the Buck & Badger.",2-star
"Although Buck and Badger has a whole section on their menu devoted to delicious looking meat burgers, I went against conventional wisdom and ordered their Veggie Burger. What the what?? I promise you it's good. The grilled portabella topped with grilled peppers and provolone cheese tastes almost like meat, if not better. Buck and Badger also has some really great cocktails (The One that Got Away, which is Jack Daniels Tennessee Honey with root beer, is tasty) as well as a large selection of beer. They also host Geeks Who Drink Trivia on Tuesdays.",4-star
Food is great. Flank steak meatloaf is amazing. Duck breast is fabulous. Unfortunately service is not. Two of us ordered soup this evening one came out with a the main course. Couldn't even fit it all on the table. My meal on the other hand never made it out she totally didn't even bring it. This is 3rd time at his restaurant and service has been less than adequate. Probably will not be back too many choices of great restaurants on State Street.,2-star
"I feel pretty let down by my two experiences at Buck & Badger. I've been for lunch and dinner. Both times, service was pretty slow, despite there not being many customers. I had the chicken pot pie ($13), which was served in a sort of upside down pyramid of a bowl... It looked large when it first came, but soon revealed itself to be shallow and a pretty sad portion for the price. It wasn' particularly flavorful either. My date had a burger, which he said was just ok. Went back a different day and had the grilled cheese with apples and fig spread. The apples turned out to be more like apple pie filling. Way too sweet! Also, $8 for a grilled cheese is quite steep, especially since you also have to pay extra to get a side of fries. I would love to love Buck & Badger, since I work a block away and they have a lovely fireplace. I can imagine having lunch there while reading a book by the fire. But I guess what it comes down to, is there are much higher quality and less expensive places to go in the area.",2-star
"I always get wary when a restaurant tries to hard to push a theme. In this case, Buck and Badger is supposed to resemble an ""Up North"" restaurant with a stuffed moosehead (fake me thinks) and a log cabin motif. Nevertheless, I thought to give it a whirl as we biked down State Street on one of the first nice days of Spring. The menu is typical American fare-wings, some salads, hamburgers made from the various animals (cow, boar, lamb, bison), and entrees. I opted for the Duck Salad (no tomatoes) while my 9 year old daughter went with the children's Mac and Cheese. The meal took a tad bit long to come out with our waiter coming out to inform us they made the salad with the tomatoes and were making me a new one. I was happy to hear that until the second attempt at the salad came out. Evidently, when I requested no tomatoes, the cook also thought Ihe/she should include any other vegetable-it was missing the red peppers, onions, and celery that the menu described While the duck was well prepared and the apple cider vinaigrette adding a nice acid to cut through the richness of the duck, the salad lacked anything crunchy and therefore was forgettable. My daughter's mac and cheese was generous in size and I appreciated the fact that the sauce was homemade and well balanced. Good but nothing to come back for. Buck and Badger would do better if it lessened the schtick around the Northwoods (really, the kid's menu item comes with an antler crown which basically guarantees a therapy visit or two when they get older from the humiliation), reduced the size of their menu, and focused on delivering well executed meals. While I would say that the restaurant won't be around long due to the amount of nearby competition (The Fountain, Coopers, etc), they probably will as the owner also owns the Capitol Tap Haus (yawn) and the Ivory Room (license to print money).",3-star
"Came here for lunch on a Thursday with some co-workers. We left with mixed feelings, most of us disappointed and won't be back. This place is pretty new. It opened in the space that Ian's Pizza moved out of. They spent quite a bit of work to completely redo the interior. They attempted to capture the up north feel, with lots of cedar wood and country decor. There was a gas fireplace in the middle of the dining room which I really liked. I got the whitefish hoagie. The menu said that all sandwiches were served with a side of sweet mustard cole slaw."" Hmm...I don't remember tasting any mustard, or any sweetness, or anything all. It was weak, mostly watery cabbage with a touch of cream. My sandwich was okay. The red pepper aioli didn't stand out. I actually thought it was melted cheese until I reviewed the menu just now. There wasn't any tartar sauce served. The sides are kind of a rip; especially the traditional fries. They're a $3 add on and they could've easily been from the frozen section at Woodman's Foods. One of my co-workers got the Wild Boar Burger, fries, and a CAN of beer. His bill was $17 before tip. Seemed pretty steep for a lunch. It'd be different if any of the 3 items were standout, but they were lacking. One co-worker had the grilled cheese sandwich with fig jam & sliced apples. He was really happy with it. Out of our group of 5, he's the only one that said he'd come back.",2-star
"So, had the weirdest experience here this past Thursday. My coworker and I decided to go get wings for lunch. They have a decent lower-cost lunch menu which works as we are both broke ass poor. We both chose snack size orders of wings with a side. When they brought our orders out, there appeared to be a huge amount of wings, double our order. We brought it to our waiter's attention as we figured we would be charged accordingly. He was a trainee and apparently hit the wrong button on the register. Now this is totally understandable, mistakes happen. The way that it was handled really blew our minds. He brought over a woman who appeared to be his manager/trainer who told us that we would have to pay more if we kept the wings, or we would need to give them back. We had started eating at this point as we had to get back to work. Did I mention that their orders take forever to come out? Anyway, she brought containers for us to pick out wings to give back to her. We were so shocked. I have never heard of a restaurant making a mistake and then asking for the food back. Wouldn't it be logical to say 'oh we made mistake, keep the order, it's on us?' Instead let's throw out the wings. At least I hope that they didn't serve them to someone else.",2-star
"I was in here yesterday and won't be back. Ever. Not if you paid me. Everything went wrong from start....to finish. The host attempted to seat us. Walked in said ""two?"" He turned around and walked away without saying a word and after a minute realized we weren't behind him because we didn't know if he was seating us, checking on a table, hello? After walking a 1/4 mile to our table which was way out in like New Delhi or something, we are seated near nobody and nothing. He dropped us off at our table in the desert which was dirty, obscure and lonely. The place was filthy, shabby, tired worn down. The next three hours, yes three, were an adventure. Our drinks took 15-20 minutes, our server looked like he just got out of county jail, our food actually arrived before the appetizers. We didnt see the guy for another 45 minutes. When the escapee arrived, he brought the carryout box the size of a pizza container we requested from another server that saw us stranded on the side of the highway. Meanwhile in the dining room, there was loud cheering because there was a baseball game going on. In our room, the game was not on. We couldn't see anyone but we knew they were there. Then we got the check. We didn't see the guy for another twenty minutes after that. I stacked the dirty plates in the corner of the table. We left with our frozen carryouts. By the way, the beer was cold and the food was ok. All on a Friday night. Behind every bad server, bad host and bad staff is a bad general manager. Loser restaurant of the year goes to *ding* bdubs of Lyndhurst. Congratulations!",1-star

Listen. Just moved here from another zip code in the immediate area. Drinks are almost half the price of the bw3 we go to AND the service is waaayyy better.

Ate here last night whole table had boneless wings that were way over cooked. I also got the breaded mushrooms that ironically were under cooked. Plus it was extremely over priced for glorified bar food. And we were shoved in a table in the back room squeezed in between 2 four tops when we asked for a booth.

Had dinner here with the family and went with the wings and a salad. My son had the combo bone-in and boneless wings with the Mango Habanero hot sauce and I had the traditional wings with Parmesan Garlic sauce. His hot sauce was way too hot for me but the Parmesan Garlic was just right for taste and heat. The wings were done well as you'd expect given the name on the establishment. My wife had the Chicken Chopped Salad and thought it was just okay. It is a typical sports bar atmosphere with multiple TVs around an open room. The noise level is relatively high as you might expect but it's a friendly place and the waitstaff is helpful. It's a place to go for decent eats at good prices and get your fill of sports.,4-star
"I almost never write negative reviews, but I feel like this is one of those times I should save you the heartache. The service for pick-up was just fine, but the food I got back left a lot to be desired. We just moved to the area, and thought BWW would be a good go-to that first week. The boneless chicken (I got 12, my wife got 12) were popcorn-chicken size. They were tasty, but seriously, seriously small. Small enough that we busted out laughing when we saw them. I like my baby chickens in egg form, please. Worse were the buffalo chips with cheese. We ended up discarding them after just starting to eat them because the entire bottom of them was adhered to a white plastic material. I'm betting that it's a big chunk of whatever bag they come in when frozen that they got cooked with, as one homogenous lump. I took a photo because I wanted my friends to see that we're now living in the future, where we're expected to eat space-age plastics. I can't wait for the next step, my BWW Spicy Hot protein pill! I normally love BWW, but I don't know why I'd come back to this one.",1-star
"Pretty bad service . Waited 10 minutes for a server that never showed, finally went to the bar and brought drinks back to our table.

Food is decent, its wings and fried stuff. Fifteen years ago bw3 was the place to go. Now there are so many other better options. Hit up winking lizard, quaker steak or even the Boneyard further down mayfield. This location is newly remodeled. It doesn't matter, it's still a hole with employees who act like you are inconveniencing them because you sat down.",1-star
"Haha, this place is a joke. I took my girlfriend here and was expecting to get some fast wings for me and whatever she wanted, of course. First of all, it took some ghetto douchebag 15 minutes to even realize we were waiting. Then, blablabla what can I get you to drink? Both of us waters. Took him 10 minutes to get us our water. So we ordered away, after waiving him down as he ran away to flirt with some girl at the counter. It took a long while for us to get our food, my girlfriend her burger, which was burnt to a hellish crisp. My wings were ok, not the best but the sauce was really weird. No refills on our drinks the ENTIRE time we sat there. He only came over once. If you're looking for good service and good food, stay away from this shithole. If you have the gas, go to Quaker Stake.",1-star
"I hate this particular restaurant. I was there three years ago and they nickel and dime'd me then and they're doing it still now. The service is awful, they have their own set of rules that are different from ALL OTHER BW3's I've been at, and it takes forever to get anything. I walked out before and I did it again recently. Awful. Horrible. Worst restaurant I have ever been. They wouldn't let me have a tall Great Lakes Christmas Ale because the waitress said ""Its too potent.' Then I over heard a waiter ask the manager why they can't sell the large Christmas Ales and he said ""Because its 75 cents more and we make more money this way."" Smart as a business option that is, they are the ONLY BW3's WHO DO THAT. Every time my glass was empty I had to scream down the bartender who was too busy talking to all his buddies instead of helping the other bartender who was taking care of tables behind the bar. I tried to order some wings, but I could only get batches of 6 when I have been able to get batches of 5 at EVERY OTHER BW3's on their Boneless and Regular wing nights. Plus, for them to be 'wet' (saucier) would cost me extra. Bleu cheese? Extra. Celery? EXTRA. Do not support this monstrosity of a restaurant.",1-star
"Every B Dubs (Buffalo Wild Wings for the great unwashed) location is completely different. Yes, it's true. Each location has its own quirks and subtleties.

Since I ordered carry-out, I didn't notice this travesty until I got home. It ruined my B Dubs meal. The wings were all-right here and the Asian Zing sauce was as tasty as ever, but I was just let down. The bone-in and boneless experience are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. Oh, and I got fries.

We were not loud or rowdy in any way but were wearing some green in light of it being March 17th. We are normal 35-40 year olds just looking to play a couple of games of pinball and have a pint or 2. We were told, very rudely I might add, that only regulars were allowed in to grace the owners presence. She said there are several other bars that would serve us right next door, so we gladly did so and I would highly recommend you do the same.

Hidden gem in the West end. If you like pinball and nice craft beers then Cabin Fever is the place for you. Pinball machines and beers seem to rotate on a 4-6 week basis so never seems stale.

"I fucking love Cabin Fever! But to be fair, what isn't there to love about quality vinyl, pinball machines, and tall boy beers for seven bucks, all packed into a little hole-in-the-wall spot?? Cabin Fever has the quirky attribute that many bars need these days. Their beer selection offered a few taps, and over a dozen tall boy beers that are all originated no more than 50km away. You can take your beer in glass, or in can if you prefer (which I recommend, as the pinball machines have cup holders). Vinyl records hang the wall with some string lights around. Usually, I'm against the seemingly lackluster hanging of string lights, but it really plays into the enjoyable ambience produced. All-in-all, Cabin Fever is the type of place that every town needs to be ""that rad place"".",5-star

It's a lovely marriage of pinball, craft beer, and vinyl. We were given helpful recommendations of the local craft beer and friendly conversation from the bartender. We went straight to the pinball machines which run about $1 per game or $2 for 3. There are just enough machines to keep you entertained for awhile, but not too many as to overwhelm or intimidate. They're all working very well, including the other arcade games such as Street Fighter II (which are only a quarter to play!). They also sell vinyl and play a rad selection of rock tunes to set the mood while you drink, play, and hang. I NEED a place like this at home. It's cozy, hip, and all around a really good time. 10/10.",5-star
"This gem is our mid week go-to! Cozy, with delicious beverages and really great drink specials! The owners are fantastic, and always friendly. Loving the fact that we can add to the vinyl collection while having a pint! Sammies available also; each one pinball ""themed"" by name. :)",5-star
Really amazing people running an innovative place. Super accommodating and friendly to this out of town visitor. Honestly my new fav place to visit and play pinball in Toronto.,5-star
"Not sure why this place has such a good rating, with so many coffee shops in the area (in the junction, bloor west, roncesvalles) there's no way a ""coffee shop"" should have a 4.5 star rating with NO WIFI IMHO. These days, it's a basic offering. Maybe I should have been tipped off by the empty Cafe w the exception of one lady getting a to-go cup and someone drinking a beer at the bar. I came here at 3pm. These were my observations in the 30 mins I was there: - LOUD: the music is loud here, so much so that the staff and patrons at the bar drinking beer are all screaming to talk over each other. To me it was car-stereo-blazing loud. - NO wifi. Go be productive elsewhere. - NO menu anywhere, so you're stuck having this conversation: C: so what do you have here? Barista: Everything. C: Oh ok, do you have hot chocolate? B: No. C: Do you have decaf coffee here? B: No. C: Can you do a chai latte? B: No, sorry. C: uh OK so what do you serve here? B: Brew coffee, Americanos, caffeinated teas... Righttt so not ""everything"". I was looking for something decaf but nothing was avail. Without a menu, not only do you now know what is available, you don't know how much things cost. FYI a cup of brew coffee is $2. Hubby said it was decent and gave it a 7/10. Oh, And you'll also have to ask the barista for the cream. Depending on what you want to do in a coffee shop (or bar in this case), it may be helpful to know that the lighting is dim here and provided entirely by Edison light bulbs. So unless you score one of the two two-seater tables by the window, it might be difficult to read a book or do paperwork here. Good aspects: - music selection was decent - appears to turn into a bar in the evening; has pin ball machines and sells records - has beers on tap. - staff was nice enough, not her fault they don't serve anything decaf or lack wifi In the end, this is definitely more of a social bar setting rather than a quiet catch up with your friend or getting work done environment which is what I was looking for at the time. I just wanted to try out a new place and wandered in.",2-star
This a lovely cafe. Very friendly woman runs the place and is very sweet and conversational. I love the front part of the store with the bay window and window seat facing bloor street. Perfect for watching the hustle and bustle of the city or people watch. Americano had amazing flavour and perfect bite to it! They also have a variety of lovely nibblys to pair with coffee or tea. Only wish ps mine would be a- to have cushions on the benches by windows to make it comfort and b- I am patio lover. I'm definitely making this my go to spot for coffee before work or walks in high park it's definitely one of the best on this stretch of bloor st w.,4-star
It's everything you've been wanting in a coffee shop. 1) amazing espresso 2) friendly staff and customers 3) awesome music and art 4) chill vibe oh and 5) The BEST buttertart in the GTA. Pinball too?!?!?,5-star
"Love this place! Great Coffee, Great people, Great Good, Great Music, Great atmosphere, FAST WiFi!! and great prices on Vinyl and damn..everything comes at a great price! I don't wanna come across as someone who is blowing smoke just cause but...Honestly its a really nice change from your average coffee company. Highly recommended for everyone. update: Just went back to get some coffee and found that they took away the wifi because people stayed too long",5-star
Adorable. Wish there was more seating so I could spend more time here. Americano was top notch. By far the coolest thing on Bloor between Lansdowne to Jane (and well beyond),5-star
"Cabin Fever Collective is the combination of a cafe and a vinyl store. I thought this was a very interesting concept and inquired the owner about it. He told me that his wife and him wanted to open a vinyl store originally because of their love for music. However, the cost of maintaining a store was a bit pricey. By making it a cafe, it helped with the store maintenance. They have a collection of vintage and pre-owned vinyls for sale, along with new releases. Cabin Fever Collective likes to support local artists and sells CDs of lesser known bands in the store. Sometimes the cafe hosts live music nights with various bands. Thursday nights are also movie nights. They like to air music documentaries to follow the theme of the cafe. The cafe also has artwork for sale by one to three artists every month. If you really love Cabin Fever Collective, you can buy and proudly wear one of their shirts ($15-$20). I enjoyed their tea latte and I liked the variety of teas made available from Herbal Fusions. You can sniff each tea in separate vials before deciding on your order. There are a lot of vials too! If you need help, the staff will gladly give you a recommendation. Overall, Cabin Fever Collective is the perfect place to be if you are a vinyl collector and want to be in a space to share your interests with other music enthusiasts.",4-star
"Staff is awesome, relaxed and super friendly. Loved the ambiance and loved their tea as well. This is the kind of place I'd visit often if I lived in Toronto!",5-star
"What a quaint relaxing place. While it's an indie coffee shop, it's not completely grungy like some hipster coffee shops. It reminds me of an upper middle class living room with its comfy couches, antique records and how well everything is organized. As for the food and drinks, well they had a great selection of pastries such as scones, butter tarts, muffins, cookies and empanadas. They also had your normal coffee selection with espresso based drinks, fancy tea and normal coffee. I had the empanada with spicy chipotle dipping and an iced coffee. The empanada was nice and crispy, fair amount of filling, sweet on the outside and salty on the inside. It also went really well with an iced coffee that was not too strong, but also not too watery. Verdict: this is a great place to chill and study. Also - they take debit and credit! Sweet for an indie coffee shop.",5-star
"This place is awesome, it screams hipster and it hurts you a little to see it everywhere you look, but we still loved it. My creme brulee chai tea latte was one of the best tea lattes I've had, they actually give you a fist sized tea sachet. it was half the drink. I had my cup refilled with water after and it was a very nice chai. Enough on drinks, the cafe itself is beautiful. You understand the name as soon as you're there. The staff were funny and friendly, happy to give me some butter for the roll of bread I brought in. Wish I lived closer! Will remember for future high park visits.",5-star
"2 Stars Cabin Fever Collective is a nice little place in High Park. It is a unique place that sells coffee and records; maybe a little odd, but every place needs there thing. Cabin Fever also has a unique vibe to it, with great music, interesting art, plants on every table, and an old suitcase as a table. They have an incredible selection of tea available and a decent selection of coffee drinks including Chemex style drip coffee. As soon as I saw this, I said 'I'll have a Chemex please'. I have watched one of the leading baristas in Canada prepare a Chemex just for me and so I watched meticulously how Cabin Fever prepared it and it was disappointing. It was prepared with not much precision; the filter wasn't even primed first before the grounds were poured in to be poured over. Ok, I know I may seem crazy and I also know I have never prepared one of these before, but I have seen some great baristas prepare one for me in the past and the way they did it looked nothing like the one prepared here. They have a great espresso machine and looks as though they prepare the other drinks with care. The food selection is as expected in a coffee shop and the music is great and adds to the good vibe here. I'm hesitant to recommend this place because I know there are others around that are better, but this place is ok. I will definitely give it a plus for trying to do something new with the selling of the records; that's pretty cool. All in all, not bad, average, and a place to come if only around the area. That's it!",2-star
"Love this place. Staff is extremely warm. Bright spots to sit in front. Cool ""woodsy cottage"" room in the back with comfortable couches. Great variety of sandwiches, snacks & teas. Always some pretty sweet tunes playing - as you might expect from a cafe/shop that sells new & used records.",5-star
"Really 4 1/2 stars. The cafe au lait - soy, of course - was really good. Lots of foam, frothy, rich. I came here via the Indie Coffee Passport and came back the very next day for another cafe au lait. For $2.25, it was a great deal. The only tiny drawback was the to-go cup which gave the coffee a bit of a cardboard aftertaste. But apparently, if you bring in your own mug, you'll get 10% off. Nice ! Music is everywhere - stacks of vinyl and music-related art all around. Behind the counter, really friendly staff; and over the counter, baked goods and sandwiches and about a trillion different teas. You can even pick up some packaged tea and related gifty merchandise, including quirky things like crocheted bow ties and cupcake soaps. Want to stay a while? Park yourself in a comfy chair in front or settle in, surrounded by books, in the quieter space in back. Pretty soon, you'll feel like you're at an old friend's place, a friend who makes really good cafe au lait.",4-star
"If you're in the area this place is definitely worth popping into. Great decor, super friendly staff, a well curated record collection and an abundance of tea. As the other reviews mentioned they don't have espresso coffee yet, but the impressive tea selection, delicious treats and good music still makes them a great destination in my book.",5-star
"What an amazing space!! Based on my first impression, hands down, my favourite cafe at the moment! It's beautiful, sweet and clean in here! The seating area reminds me of a living room/dining area in an interior decorating magazine or something. It's very homey, clean and simple with cute little accents. Feels like going over to my stylish best friend's condo lol. The friendly owner has a wide selection of teas and a little sampling display where you can smell each flavour before ordering. I'm making it my goal to try each flavour at least once lol. I'm not a pastry person, BUT you must try their BUTTER TARTS! The red velvet cupcake is amazing too! BUT THE BUTTER TART! I've never had a flakey crust butter tart before! It's such a good idea!",5-star
"Spent about 3 hours here on a Wednesday afternoon working on my laptop. Fantastic selection of tasty teas, scrumptious desserts, great music, captivating decor and really nice staff. I''ll definitely be back.",5-star
"My server Shelby was AMAZING!!!! My daughter can't stop talking about how she is the kindest, sweetest waitress she has ever meet, she can't wait to go back and see her new friend. Thank you Shelby for making our lunch date even more special. Thank you for the recommendations on the food and drinks! We will definitely be going back and we are going to ask to be seated at Shelby's area for sure!!",5-star
Walked into CPK and within seconds i was greeted with a big smile and sat to a table. My server Terri was fricking awesome. She was so kinda a d full of energy like myself. We continued to bounce our positive vibes off of each other. It was so refreshing to have such an up beat server who matched my high. My food was so delicious/ the best gluten free pizza ever,5-star
"I haven't been to CPK in a few years, so it was nice to be back. Had dinner last night here at this location. Our server was great, I believe his name is Ry? Anyways, he quickly greeted us and got waters out giving us a few moments to look over the drink menu. I got a blue moon, wife got a glass of house red, and our friend ordered a red sangria. So far so good, we then ordered our appetizers. Buffalo Cauliflower & the street corn. Both delicious. Then, our entrees were brought out, my friend ordered the BBQ pizza, wife had the Carne Asada pizza, and I had the Bowl. I can't remember what it's called. Lol. Anyways, everything was delicious. It was great to be back. Service was on point and so was the food. I would recommend and I would come back much sooner than a few years. :)",5-star
Worst service when busy..no silverware no bread..waiting close to an hour ignoring us completely.. They treated w/o respect & below average and service was unfair.,1-star
"The first time I went here was a good experience. I dug it. The second time was just two nights ago where we had a waitress named Jess and she was KILLING it! She was engaged with us, joking around with us like we've been friends for 5 years, and regularly checked up on us. I wish service like this was more common as this is half of what I want when I go out to eat. I had the Wagyu burger this time around as opposed to pizza and happy I did. Unlike my last documented experience with Wagyu at a Korean BBQ place, this Wagyu was FANTASTIC! Paid the $3 upcharge for their fries w/ truffle ketchup... Worth. It. Last thing, the blueberry whiskey drink was STRONG! Which is specifically what I asked her for haha. I'm a fan. Don't sleep on this place if you go to downtown summerlin. You could live the rest of your life never experiencing real happiness. You're better than that.",5-star
If you are a couple the best dining experiences are always at the bar. Rich highly recommended the steak pizza and the shrimp scamp pizza- yummy cook to perfection! No black dough! And the sangria and margarita complimented both perfectly! The bar takes care of you!,5-star
"My boyfriend and I went here yesterday and our overall experience was great! It was a little rocky at first...hence the 4 stars...but it got better! We were seated and it took a really long time for someone to come and ask what drinks we wanted. However, once the drinks were brought over it was smooth sailing. We got everything we ordered really fast and everything was delicious. The waiter was a little quiet and serious, but he was nice.. Will be back :)",4-star
"Pizza is always a good idea! Super funny and friendly staff at this place. Pizza was yummy. However, we asked to sit outside, we were super hot since we didn't have shade. We sat by some beautiful flowers, didn't realize there were flies. They started to come out half way we were done with our meal. One fly ended up get stuck on a piece of pizza and the other one in our drink. I know it's nature, but they shouldn't be sitting people in that little area by the plants. Don't ask to sit outside in the uncovered spot by plants.",3-star
"Brought my family here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We had a party of 6 and were seated immediately in a booth. I didn't know they had patio dining and were never offered which was a huge disappointment. They weather was beautiful and it would have been nice to have that option. The service was ok. I felt like we needed refills throughout our entire lunch and never got bread until we asked. The restaurant was not busy and I felt like we were a forgotten table. The food on the other hand was amazing! We ordered the spinach artichoke dip to start and I had the BANH MI BOWL. This was an absolutely amazing, healthy choice that had quinoa, baby kale, fresh cilantro & mint topped with grilled chicken, watermelon radishes, fresh avocado, cucumbers, carrots, bean sprouts, scallions and sesame seeds. It was light, fresh and filling with a hint of spice. I will definitely come back and now that I know they have patio dining I will opt to sit outside. 5* for the food! Hopefully I get a better service next time.",4-star
"On Friday afternoon we arrived at California pizza kitchen in Summerlin about 3 PM when someone finally acknowledged our presence and we got a table outside after we set down it was at least 20 minutes before someone asked us for a drink . The waitress that asked us if we wanted a drink her hygiene was definitely a one star . The whole Staff was unprofessional,From the tattoos to the saggy pants . We will Never return to this location we were really appalled at our whole experience at California pizza kitchen. This was probably the worst service we have experienced. I am a Las Vegas native and I will share my dining experience with my family and friends . Thank You",1-star
"No matter what time of the day you go to this location it will be busy. They do a good job of turning the tables, and staff is very knowledgeable of the menu. The wait time once you place the order could be a bit quicker. Overall a decent spot.",3-star
"There's just something about CPK that keeps bringing us back. I like CPK for their Cedar Plank Salmon ($19) and their West Coast Burger (formerly the CPK Burger / $14). The salmon is blackened perfectly and kept unseasoned by request. It's so good that I will have my salmon with a side of additional salmon. Their burger is surprisingly awesome and has become one of my favorite items on their menu. The burger patty is made up of ground chuck and brisket. It's so juicy and delicious. The only issue with their burgers is that it doesn't come with a side. CPK also has other things on their menu like soups, salads, steaks, and even pizza. Their signature is the BBQ Chicken Pizza. Overall, it's not too bad. I rather just stick to their salmon and burger.",4-star
"came here with my brother, sister and mother. first off the server never brought us the bread that was in ""oven"". he mentioned this 2 times while we were waiting for our food. He was very kind and informative with the menu, but not very attentive to us after we ordered. our waters and drinks took time to refill. not by him, but by 2 other girls that did come by and helped out. I ordered the poke chop chop salad, this salad was drenched in the dressing that was over powering and the worse part was that there was only 6 pieces of tuna on the salad on top. the restaurant wasn't busy, even on a tuesday afternoon. don't get me wrong the restaurant looked very nice and modern, just not the service. it seems like the servers, bussers and bartender rather converse with each other than the customers. if you enjoy the food at CPK, go for it. i personally won't come back for the service or food quality.",1-star
"Wilted and dirty lettuce. Ordered through Grubhub. Called CPK asking for a remake in the future. They told me to call Grubhub. They then said that their lettuce is washed daily. Well clearly from the picture, they sent out a poor product, at least apologize and ""ask how can we fix this for you?"". My family and I give CPK a lot of business. Not a very good client experience.",3-star
"This is without a doubt the worst CPK that I've ever been to, and I eat CPK about 50 times a year. First off, they have a totally different menu. No chicken lettuce wraps, which were my wife's favorite. I ordered the Ban Mi Bowl and the chicken was burned. I said something to the waitress and nothing was done. I got a curt sorry about that, but no further action. Most restaurants would offer to bring a fresh plate or even comp the dish since it was ruined, neither was offered. When she cleared the plate it was clear that I only ate about 15% of the meal, only that much because I was so hungry. We ordered the chocolate soufflé for desert. It was cold, barely room temperature. I mentioned it to another waitress that was helping out. She said she would let the manager know. Again, it would have been nice to offer a new dish or at least take the cold plate they served off the check. Ten minutes later the check comes with no sign of the manager and no adjustment to the bill. But most importantly, no apology. Hopefully this review will help others to avoid this CPK or perhaps get them to clean their act up.",1-star
"Third visit, third time unsatisfied. We came in on Friday at 4pm. We ordered at about 4:10pm food didn't arrive at our table till after 5pm and it was wrong. But it only took them less then 10min to remake it. This restaurant is so poorly mismanaged that there was more employees then customers and the employees were mostly talking to each other then working. It's too high price for average food and poor service. Three strikes and now California Pizza will never see me again.",1-star
"The hamburgers are really good. The service is above par and friendly. The price is fair, and the waitresses return often with drink refills.",4-star
Perfect place to come when I need my carb fix! My girlfriend and I were here for lunch today. I had the chicken tequila fettuccine and she had the bahn mi power bowl. We also split the avocado club egg rolls. Everything was absolutely delicious and our server Rich was on point. Next time I come here I'll make sure that I don't have to go to work right after so I can have the sangria flight!,5-star
"Wow! I had a great experience Saturday for lunch. And I couldn't rave more about the food. My friend and I split a pizza and salad. The thai crunch salad was amazing- especially with avacado. And the mushroom pizza with truffle oil cannot be described! We had great service, and a nice ambiance. The only peculiar thing is the sinks to wash your hands are outside the bathrooms. It's interesting.",4-star
"My family came here for dinner last Friday. And My husband and I were very impressed with this locations. Since the waitress was so busy the manager took our drink and food orders and they both came very quick! Food is always amazing at CPK. The restaurant was so busy but both manager and waitress was always there to make sure we were taking care of! Great service, food and I like the ambience.",5-star
"I haven't had a bad meal yet at a CPK, but what really set this visit apart was the exceptional level of attention paid by our server, Chris. Very friendly, professional, and welcoming, our party of seven wanted for nothing the entire visit. With excellent service seemingly becoming more and more scarce, I hope the DTS CPK management realize what a rare gem they have--it's not solely good food that keeps people coming back. So if you ever find yourself at the DTS CPK, ask for Chris and you'll experience a new level of service that may raise your expectations of waitstaff everywhere else you go. Oh yeah, and try the new seared ahi burger, it's pretty darn good, too!",5-star

"The epitome of customer service on top of great food, I can't wait to give them my business again! My wife and I brought our son for dinner to find out the gender of our expected baby (due Feb. 2016). I gave the hostess the sealed envelope from the doctor's office when my wife arrived. As soon as I brought up the idea for some type of dessert-related reveal, the whole CPK team in Downtown Summerlin was on board and excited for us! Before dessert even came out, Sierra took excellent care of us. Then CPK helped make the moment memorable and special by providing a special note and creative reveal. When we dug into our ice cream and shortcake, it was packed with BLUEberries, and we're having a boy!! What an awesome night made special by everyone at CPK who watched as we dug in to share in our excitement. Thank you, thank you, thank you, CPK of Downtown Summerlin!!!",5-star
"I really don't like writing a negative review, but sadly this is the second one in a week. My wife and I went to CPK for a lunchtime meeting with a small group of other parents from our son's school. After not eating at a sit-down CPK for several years due to a bad experience, history repeated itself at another of their restaurants 2400 miles away. Right after we were seated, our waitress took our drink orders. She wasn't unpleasant but seemed a little put out that she had to be there. Everyone's entitled to a bad day and she was doing her job, so it was hard to be critical at this point. She brought our drinks then disappeared. Fifty minutes later, and with mostly empty glasses on the table she returned to take our lunch orders, now making faces as if she'd been forced to be there and deal with customers. At that point, she'd gone from a server I thought was having a bad day but doing her job (gets the benefit of the doubt), to a server who disappeared for almost an hour, then returned seeming even irritated that she had to do her job. What was equally stunning was during that 50 minute absence, no other members of the waitstaff seemed to notice we weren't being taken care of. I know they saw us (eye contact) as we kept looking around for our waitress but it seemed as if they either weren't supposed to back her up. Or they didn't care. With somewhat limited time left for lunch at that point, my wife and I asked our waitress if our food could be rushed, explaining we both needed to leave 30 minutes later. She said it wouldn't be a problem, so we ordered. Thirty minutes went by without seeing our waitress again and my wife got up to leave to make her next appointment. It was just at that time our food started coming out. I needed to leave as well but remained to asked the waitress to please box our two meals to go, and to bring me the check. Once again she seemed annoyed that I asked her to do something, and she even looked surprised that after ordering our food to eat there, I apparently decided I wanted it to go instead. I reminded her we had told her we needed to leave 30 minutes from the time we ordered (and an hour and a half after we were seated). I paid and was out the door about 10 minutes later. I've only walked out of a restaurant without paying one time in my life. This would have been the second time, but I didn't want CPK to stick my bill with our friends. I like the CPK menu the several times I've eaten their food: in full-service restaurants, in airports and even their frozen pizzas. Most of this was before I joined Yelp. Oddly, several years ago in Baltimore, MD, I had the identical experience at a CPK full-service restaurant there. The management was unconcerned and unapologetic. That was the last time I ate at a full-service CPK. This time, the lunch venue was picked by others in the group and I figured I could get over my previous bad experience--maybe it was just a singular event. I was stunned to see the identical lack of desire to take care of the customer here in Las Vegas: two restaurants on opposite sides of the country that provided an almost identical experience. I know there are a lot of CPK fans out there, but for my wife and I, this visit only confirm my original observation that I don't need to dine at a CPK restaurant again, especially when there are so many other wonderful dining options available.",1-star
"Alright guys... so I've worked in restaurants so I know how hard being a server can be sometimes. However saying that, I've worked with people who are just not cut out to be in the service industry. It's not for everyone. Every restaurant I've worked in as a server, you're expected to know the cocktails and foods that are offered, at minimum. So when it took our server 15 minutes to actually greet us and take our beverage order I thought ordering a margarita was pretty basic. So another 15 minutes when pink drinks were being dropped off at the table I was slightly confused where I was informed that they were the ""platinum margaritas"" that we had ordered. Weird, I remember ordering a margarita and asking what tequila was used (the server couldn't answer that so I said well was fine) but not a platinum margarita. Upon sending it back I noticed on the menu that the platinum was significantly more expensive (which I wouldn't mind paying for, if that was actually what I wanted in the first place) and it came with my choice of chambord or grand marinier in terms of a cadillac margarita. Hmmmm... so instead of asking which we preferred she automatically put in chambord while upselling us without our permission. Shady. Fast forward to 30 minutes and four trips to the table later. I have successfully had to explain to our server what chambord is, what grand marnier is, and what a cadillac margarita is. (They don't teach these things in training?!) The manager had to stop by the table because after the fifth time when the server couldn't get a request right as simple as extra salt on a margarita for my friend, we have just had it. 45 minutes to get a simple margarita order right is completely unacceptable. I'm sorry to say this, but this has to be hands down the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. And I didn't even try the food because the service was so incompetent. Such a shame.",1-star
"I have eaten at CPK many times before but this is my first time at the one in Downtown Summerlin. The difference between the others that I have been in and this one is obvious as soon as you walk in. The Summerlin store is strikingly pretty, with an attractive bar on the left and a glass wall on the right that looks out onto the patio eating area. Our server came to the table almost immediately to take our drink orders. She came back a short while later with a complimentary sample of their special soup (which was delish!). We decided to share a full-sized Cobb salad. More than enough for two hungry adults. And quite tasty. Lots of chicken, egg, bacon, tomato and bleu cheese crumbles. Overall, a very nice way to take a break from the busy afternoon of shopping.",4-star
"I was extremely impressed with both the food and service! I had never eaten at CPK, but ive been listening to the boufriend rave about it for 5 years. We finally made it to the new Summerlin location so he could fill his craving for tequila chicken fettucine! I ordered the same entree and thought the flavor was amazing! Actually, the only reason we didnt give 5 stars was both of thought there couldve been more chicken in the pasta (there really wasnt very much chicken in either of ours). For an appetizer we had the club egg rolls...wow were they fantastic!! We were very surprised at how much we enjoyed these delicious, crispy egg rolls. We also split a half order sized ceasar salad with dinner. The salad was dressed perfectly and the dressing tasted great. Overall, the whole experience was a winner. We were both very satisfied with the service. Our waitress was Stephanie and she was fabulous! She was attentive, full of suggestions and super friendly! She even told us the secret to eating the amazing egg rolls!!! We will certainly be back for more amazing food!!",4-star
Too bad we sat for 20 minutes before getting a server. This was after going inside after 10 minutes and complaining with the promise of sending someone right out. Finally flagged down someone serving another table (that had arrived 15 minutes after us). How hard is this? Part 2 - person with the little dog and feeding it from the table - what next.,1-star
"CPK leaves much to be desired in their food presentation and portions. I came to this new location with a friend and we ordered 2 salads of the same size, but different types. What was served was very odd to say the least and pretty darn disappointing. I had asked for my salad to be modified, because I can not eat onions and everything seemed okay until the waitress came back to mention a small issue. The waitress had said that she could make me an Asian chicken salad, but the cabbage with the onions would not be included, so she suggested that I add more romaine instead. I thought nothing of it and agreed to her suggestion. What was weird is that this simple modification became a small food nightmare for me. I did not realize that just by subtracting an item that I am allergic to I was going to get a miserly portion. This really should not be the case. As I had mentioned earlier my friend and I ordered the same size salad and my was literally half her size, yet we paid the same price for it. The worst part is that I literally got about maybe 2 oz of chicken for my large salad what cost a whopping $14 and this just makes me down right annoyed. Why are you skimping on the ingredients just because I requested for 1 small thing to be removed? So in a nutshell I ended up paying for a few pieces of lousy lettuce and 4 paper thin pieces of chicken and still left hungry.

"Our waitress, Ellen, is nice as can be! What a lovely person to be able to interact with while enjoying a great meal! :) We were also frequently helped by another really nice woman named Maylani. There wasn't a moment in time when our glasses weren't full. :) The food was absolutely amazing! We couldn't believe how quickly the food came out despite how incredibly busy they were. I got the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine, and I fell in love with the immense amount of flavor that was packed into such a perfectly sized pasta dish! I can't wait to come back and dine again!",5-star
"I've been here a few times now and I can see this place becoming a regular haunt for myself and my coworkers. We recently organized a social outing at Chalkers to celebrate a milestone for one of our colleagues. We had ordered a few platters of appetizers to share amongst ourselves and between the servers and the manager, we were well taken care of. Water, napkins, etc. were refilled without issue and there was always someone available to take drink orders. The food was ok - some people really enjoyed the wings, but the nachos were a bit lacking in the cheese department. I'd be sure to order extra cheese next time. The rest of the food was alright - it's pub food, so it is what it is. Nothing outstanding but nothing bad, either. The pool tables seem to be nicely maintained, and there was a decent selection of cues from what I could see. We will definitely be back for our next outing; hopefully when the sun sticks around, we will hit up the patio.",4-star
"I go to Chalker's all the time for various Meetup events. It's a really fun, warm and inviting place, with so much to see and do. They have a large space, with several pool tables, a couple of projectors and large screens for watching movies or sports, and a large dance floor, with a great sound system and lots of disco balls and lights. The wait staff is always friendly, though when the place is packed, service can be slow. The food is great -- they do a wonderful Shepherd's Pie and their Lemon Chicken is delightful. A little pricy for a bar, but if you're going to an event it's worth it, as everyone is so friendly. My biggest gripe are the washrooms. They get filthy fast during a big event, and sometimes I walk in and just walk out because it's not clean. Also, they have those taps that you must push and HOLD to wash your hands. Which makes it impossible to really wash your hands, as you're constantly holding in the tap to get water. Hand sanitizer is a must! (They really should switch to automated facets, as those are so common and much more sanitary.) Overall, a great place for a fun night out.",3-star
Great place for pool and drinks but that's about it. The food is sometimes cooked sometimes what you ordered and sometimes warm if you get it at all. It's hit and miss but more miss. My two starts is for the wait staff. Those girls are great at what they do and get the backlash for how awful the cook is. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE REPLACE YOUR COOK. This place was so much better before it changed owners.,2-star
since when do your servers start automatically including a 15% tip on the bill? i usually tip 20% but the next time i pass by if i see that on my bill...i intend to leave 0% tip or ill stop going to your establishment all together. the service isnt so grandiose that they should start making tips mandatory.. if you can name me another pool hall in toronto that has tips included in its bills...please enlighten me. everything else about the place is fine. not high end...but a cool spot none the less,3-star

"Chalker's, a great place to play pool. Initially I was gonna give this place a four star. My mind has changed after eating here as it was an awful experience. Only reason I give this place a two star is because they have a lot if pool tables and the tables are not broken down. Instantly was unimpressed when our group of around 10 sat down and began to order drinks. Well all finished ordering and one of my friends wanted to order a water as well as she is walking away. She came back and I have never seen such a disgusted and rude face for asking for a water. Being a server in the past I can understand the extra attention gets on your nerves at times, but don't show it with your body language. On top of that it was not even busy...she had a cool accent but it doesn't excuse being so rude. The food was nothing special, it was actually below par for pub food, not sure how you can get there but it did. The burger and fries were crummy looking. The nachos stuck to the parchment paper and was burnt because the cheese was not spread out on the nachos. The thing that really turned me off about this place was that they had a drink promo going on for the Jays game and they tried to charge regular price for a couple of them and I caught it after she told me my total and I finished paying. I thought to myself this does not add up and realized she didn't even give me my bill when I was paying, just a total amount. I'd come back for the pool tables, and that's it. JimStar Out!!",2-star
"Service has really stepped up, it was really good, but the food... the menu needs some serious help and so does the cook ... we were all set for a huge meal with appetizers main dessert etc...celebrating a birthday -party of 5 - and we all stopped after the natchos...they used stale actual tomatoe sauce with a tiny bit of ground beef and this was this ""beef topping "" for an extra $ 5 ... needless to say we grabbed the bill at that point and headed downtown. Too bad too, such a convenient location. We are done with this place, gave it too many chances now. GET SOME DECENT FOOD!!",1-star
"Probably one of the nicest, coziest, and biggest pubs north of the downtown core. Along Marlee Chalkers takes up the second level of a 2 storey plaza with a beautiful wrap around patio veranda that's ideal for summer time drinks and party. The interior layout is convenient and complete with pool tables, small stage for band to perform and plenty of seating all around this venue. The menu has variety from your typical bar fares to some gourmet foods...yes gourmet I say. They're recent change in chefs have slightly altered the menu have had a positive response on my part. Their fries are crispy minus the crazy oil, beer selections are good, and their pizzas are thin crust gourmet. Kudos on the pizza...their margarita pizza was phenomenal! Prices and portions are worth the cost! If I'm ever in the area I'll definitely hit this place up anytime, especially during the summertime!",4-star
"Disappointed :( went For wings with some friends and discovered that the menu has changed, as has the food. The wings are no longer the most amazing wings ever, even the sauce has changed, they tasted more like the type you get from the frozen section at the grocery. I used to love this place and their wings, now I'm just sad and won't be recommending it anymore",1-star

Always a great time!",5-star
"For what it is, this place is pretty great. Went with a group of Yelpers after the CMYE at Bigabaldi's and we cooled down with some drinks on their nice big second story deck. Prices were pretty good, Wednesday nights happened to be ladies night which meant the normally $9 martinis were $6. Also, pool was free for ladies tonight, not that any of us played. I drank a caesar, and though it was hardly transcendent it was well-mixed and nice and spicy. Service was great, our server Jackie was a total sweetheart, happily giving our large group seperate checks, checking on us without being overbearing. All in all, somewhere I'd definitely hit after pizza, though prob not something that on it's own would draw me to the hood. Parking spots out front, and I believe I saw a sign saying more in the back.",4-star
"I like this place! It would probably be a 3* if not for the big deck. The food is pretty good, the inside is large, and they seem to have a bunch of activities like quick salsa lessons (at least they did last time I was there...which was a while ago). But if you're looking for a good local spot on an unobstructed patio, Chalkers is definitely a good option.",4-star
"Chili's is basically my favorite place to go when I want to have a burger/wings and/or go out with family and/or celebrate something. There's a lotta fancy restaurants I used to wanna go to for my birthday or anniversary, etc. And they all had a couple of things in common: they were all expensive, you had to reserve in advance to get a table you want, and I never felt comfortable ( the last one is probably just all me ). Anyway, I almost always had a disappointing experience with either getting a table that was in a high traffic zone or just feeling like the food just isn't worth the money. Then, I finally came to my senses and realized the solution was there staring me in the face all along!! Chili's! So now, whether it is my birthday, whether I got a promotion, whether it's my anniversary or whether I win the lottery, I will always go to Chili's to celebrate. I came to this location earlier this week to celebrate my anniversary. I didn't have to make a reservation. I got to wear shorts and a t-shirt and sit in a comfortable booth. I had wings and a burger and they were amazing. They were worth every penny. Best of all, I felt like I belonged there! Pictures are posted. I highly recommend the Alex burger and the bone-in wings!!",5-star
"I don't expect much from Chili's and I eat there once or twice a month. However tonight I ordered a flat bread and it was terrible. It was soggy and undercooked and I had to send it back. The bartender was apologetic and offered to give me something else, but didn't take it off the bill. Definitely disappointed.",1-star

"Meh, it was fine. I was meeting up with a friend to do some shopping and she suggested we grab a bite here. It wasn't my first choice with all the other good options around but she loves this place so I figured - why not. The place was busy, but not overwhelming. It took a minute to get a seat and then for our waitress to come over, but once she greeted us she was pretty pleasant. I ordered the mango chile chicken from the lighter options it's a chicken breast topped with spices, mango and avocado. On the side rice and broccoli. I loved the hidden spice in this dish. The mix of sweet and spicy were a treat to my tastebuds! But the sides were awful! The rice was cold, hard and crunchy and the broccoli was wayyyy over cooked. Yuck, no thank you. Like I said, this wouldn't be my first choice for food in the area. But overall, everything was just okay.",3-star
I read through all of the reviews and had to disclaim many because of situational topics. I do not like chain restaurants...however we pulled the trigger because nothing in the area fit.

"My husband, daughter, and I went to the Arboretum location on New Years Eve because there was quite a long wait at another restaurant in the same shopping center. I have eaten here before with my daughter, and was satisfied; however, it seemed to me that Chili's has undergone some sort of new gimic. They are trying to be something they are not. The first clue that things were going to be disappointing was the fact that the restaurant was practically empty on New Year's Eve! Other clues, the waitresses were wearing some sort of black, beer t-shirts, and they had a mix of music - mostly 70-80's classic rock blaring in the restaurant. I had to ask them to turn the volume down as we were there to have dinner, not dance! Lastly, the food was not served properly, and my meal (sirloin steak, mashed potatoes & salad) was not good at all. The salad dressing was watered down, or some super cheap brand - no flavor, the steak had no flavor, and the potatoes lacked flavor, and were so hot (served in a cast iron skillet), that you couldn't eat them. They also brought out my steak and told me that the rest wasn't ready yet, and they would bring it out when it was ready! The ""rest"" was the potatoes that were tasteless and too hot to eat - overcooked! I sent the steak back and told them to serve it when they had my side item ready, as I was not interested in eating one item at a time. They also did not serve any bread with the steak dinner. Another disappointing issue with this restaurant was the fact that they had a very limited selection for wine, and they few options that were on the menu, didn't have any prices, so my husband was quite surprised when the bill arrived and my glass of wine cost $7! IMHO, that is a pricey glass of wine for this type of restaurant. Lastly, as we were eating our dinner, one of the kitchen staff came storming out of the kitchen area, slapping a towel against the walls, as he approached the manager/host, for some unknown reason! Chili's needs to return to being a family friendly restaurant with a little class, a place where everyone in the family can find something to eat. They are not a microbrewery, nor are they a sports bar, so they should not try to compete with those types of establishments. Ultimate FAILURE!!",2-star
"My most recent visit last night left me very disappointed. I am used to good service, solid menu choices & a generally pleasant experience. However, last night, service was poor, food took forever & when my Margarita chicken bowl finally came it was sans chicken.

What I got back was barely edible & left me wishing I could throw up & just start over!!! Nothing was comped, no apology & not going back anytime soon...",1-star

Still tipped because I figured maybe she's having a bad night. Okay, fine. Maybe it was a bad night despite the whole place being empty. Tonight, I decided to give it another shot. Asked to sit outside in the smoking section. The hostess explained the smoking area isn't served, okay, we can sit in the patio section then. No biggie. After waiting a good 15 minutes no one came to even ask if we wanted water. Odd, the smoking section is being served from what we can see. We ended up leaving and handing the hostess back the menu's who seemed unbothered by it anyway. Her response was a snippy have a goodnight. Won't make this mistake again!",1-star

Was other person supposed to eat their's? or wait until everyone is served? We don't eat until everyone is served. It is extremely rude to do so. 5 mins pass and my meal comes, my friend's meal (pasta) is now ice cold. Not interested in our meals at that point. We offered to pay for our drinks and left. Cook should of checked meals! waitress double checked and when a meal goes back the whole table goes back to stay warm.",1-star
Chills really has stepped up their game over the past few years. This particular location seems to have relatively slow service. But overall the food is the bomb (I always get the same thing-mango chile chicken. ) good drinks decent prices and good atmosphere! I probably shouldn't leave a review before I actually get the food. Multiple people had the wrong sides and chicken wasn't properly cooked :( yuck WORSR CUSTOMER SERVICE IVE EVER SEEN IN A RESTAURANT. the manager was literally horrible. Tried to make us pay for the raw chicken and then took it away and she ended up never eating anything. Calling corporate on this particular chills. Horrible horrible experience.,1-star
"Chili's, a blast from the past. I have always passed right by this place when visiting The Arboretum, but decided, ""why not"", to give it a try. I arrived a little after 12:00pm on Sunday afternoon and requested a booth, which I received. Once seated I was greeted for my drink order and asked if I would like chips, absolutely! The chips were SO fresh and I truly enjoyed the salsa. My margarita arrived, delish! After reviewing the menu I asked the waitress for her thoughts between two dishes and she highly recommended the fajitas. I ordered the chicken fajitas with the side of rice and beans, for an extra $.99. Note: Won't bother with the rice and beans next time. As for the fajitas, they arrived, not sizzling and a little blah, as you can see from my first photo. I requested they re cook the chicken and veggies, well done, and they were amazing, see 2nd photo. I ate the entire dish, while I continued to enjoy the chips, and got some to to :-). So, I was torn on my review, but my reasoning for 3 stars at this point: 1st visit in years, second, the hostess seemed to be monitoring the tables consistently, which made me feel rushed. I know restaurants expect a good turnaround, especially at lunch, however, I was not sitting there talking. I ordered a second drink and continued to eat, until I was ready to go. I do hope to get back soon, try something different and update my review. Overall, I am glad I stop at Chiki's and look forward to giving them another shot or two.",3-star
I eat here regularly and have always had a great experience. The staff is great and the food is really good. We always eat from the 2 for $20 menu which includes an appetizer. You pay on a computer at your rather than having to wait on your waiter. I recommend this restaurant to couples.,5-star
"This is the Arboretum Chili's. You may have heard that Chili's corporately was going to respond to increasing pressure from places like Qdoba and Chipotle by greater emphasis on the Southwest dishes. They definitely have made this change, and not for the better. You can still find a few good old reliable burgers and salads that used to make this my go-to place for dinner with guests, but the new menu is so over-biased with Tex-Mex that the rest suffer. Surprisingly the fajitas, long a staple at Chili's, were absolutely HORRIBLE. The steak was tough and chewy .. and the portions reduced. The new hot spicy taco shells they use for everything are also a horrible over-use of spice. After years of going here, my wife swore she'd never go again, it was that bad. A shame.",2-star
"Went here for a weekday lunch. Place seemed understaffed even though it wasn't busy at all. Lots of waiting to be seated, waiting for service, waiting to get our check. (Our table and the table on either side of us all had empty ketchup bottles; that's a reflection of either their food quality or their attention to detail.) The restaurant itself is nicely laid out, with several areas of tables/booths, and a bar area that nicely divides the areas to keep the place from feeling like one big warehouse space. Our food wasn't bad but wasn't good, either (hence the two-star rating). I had bacon chicken avocado sandwich on pretzel roll; it was nice. My wife had cheesesteak with provolone and onions/peppers; hers was really dried out and unappetizing. Overall, not bad but not great. We might try it again if we are already at the Arboretum shopping center where this place is located, but it definitely won't be a ""destination"" on our dining list.",2-star
"I used to love this place. I thought the food was pretty good for a chain. Over the last year or so, the food has gone downhill. I've been to both Arboreteum and Blakeney. They have stopped washing the lettuce in the salads. They have the bagged salad taste. I had to send a salad back because the lettuce was partially rotten. It looked like they tried to stretch the lettuce another day. Also ordered buffalo wings. They came out slimy and gross at Blakeney. Overall I no longer recommend Chilis. I guess with the economy shortcuts and food quality have suffered.",1-star

"After graduating from college in the Pittsburgh area, I think Condado Tacos is the place I'm gonna miss the most. It truly is a taco eatery in a league of its own. First off, I LOVE that condado has solid vegetarian protein options, rather than most taco places which just have a singular options. Here, you can choose from Thai chili tofu, pulled jackfruit, mushrooms, or even rice and beens. My personal favorite is the tofu, which is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Next, you can choose from pre made tacos or build your own. Normally, I build my own so that I can put all the toppings and sauces that my heart desires. Another unique aspect is that condado has double shell tacos, with one soft and one hard, plus other fillings like quest and gauc, without costing extra! Normally, I can get two very filling tacos for under $10 here. At happy hour, there are margherita deals and $1 off tacos. Another cool thing that condado offers is the option to mix two flavors in your margherita, like strawberry-mango, etc. Honestly, I could go on and on raving about this place but you should go check it out for yourself :)",5-star
"I ate here again and LOVED my tacos and guacamole. The chips could be better, maybe more salt. I like that it's build your own, I wish there were seafood options like crab, lobster and shrimp. As much as I love these tacos I have to say if I eat more than two things I get sick...",4-star
"I first visited Condado when they opened in Pittsburgh and was not impressed. This visit was much better! Meet some friends for happy hour. You can't beat the special here! Drinks: Extensive drink menu with so many margarita flavors. I had the blood orange and will have it again in the future! My friends had Blackberry and pomegranate, which were also very good. They even offer margarita flights to sample some of the flavors. Food: We had the usual chips and queso to start. Nothing special, but how can you not? Then we ordered tacos. They have a preset menu or you can build your own. I did a build-your-own with chorizo. Very good! I had the pulled chicken before and was not as impressed. The tacos are a generous size. Order two for a complete meal. The build-you-own menu offers a number of salsas/tortillas/meats/toppings - you can't go wrong! Space: Condado has two floors. We sat downstairs. Seating is tight! Just a heads up if that's not your thing... Super excited to make this a go to happy hour stop this summer!",4-star
"Most delicious tacos ever. You have to like spicy though because everything has a bite to it. Also, be prepared for a wait, especially if you have a larger group, but most definitely worth it.",4-star
"First things first, GET THE BRISKET, explanation below. I'm a big fan of Condado. IMO, it's a mix between fast food tacos and gourmet tacos. There's a ton of great options. I like building my own tacos and adding as much as I'd like. I highly recommend the brisket, it's extremely flavorful and not dry. Service is good, food comes out fast, and it's cheap compared to other tacos joints.",5-star

"I have been back to Condado a few times since my first visit when they first opened and I just don't feel they are living up to their original standard they set last year for me. While their food, in my opinion, is still good and their combinations creative/endless, my issue stands with their service. If I were rating based on service and the interaction I've had with employees alone, I'd give 2 stars and even that is being generous. I've been here 3-4 times with reservations and it's never been a simple process. I would think with such a large upstairs space and the fact that they promote brunch so heavily on the weekends, that they would expect the crowd that comes and not act like they're trying to keep their head above water taking care of customers. During any visit I've made recently, there were issues with the reservation not being communicated/tables not being set up, the service being slow/confusing/clustered or our food not coming out correctly. These are all relatively minor things to be resolved, but creates an irritating experience when they happen, especially on a repeated basis. The employees seem to be there more to interact with each other and socialize than to actually do their job. This past weekend we had a large party for my birthday and while our waitress was doing the best she could, they set us up in this most misconstrued configuration of 3 tables all facing different direction and we had one person taking care of all of us ON TOP of her other tables upstairs. This caused a lot of confusion both for her and us and probably would have been helpful to have more hands on deck. Not to mention not one person at my table felt they actually received what they ordered, but that's not the waitress' fault. Overall I love the idea and the atmosphere (and the margs) at Condado, but there are definitely areas that need work. Seems fun & great for a group of people, but ends up being more frustrating and inconvenient, in my experience, once it's all said and done.",3-star
"We've heard good things about this place and were excited to try out a new taco joint hoping it was different than the other ten that are in town. We arrived and were quickly seated at a table that was far too small for two people. We only ordered drinks, chips and tacos but they didn't fit on our table. The service was slow and our server acted like she had better things to do. We waited over 20 minutes for our drinks and in that time we contemplated leaving. We stayed because we were so hungry and hoped anything we ordered would change our minds. We both ordered a few tacos including the surf and turf taco which we were told wasn't ready yet because he seviche wasn't prepared. It was happy hour, so assuming it was a busy time it should have been prepared. We didn't replace it with something else and quickly ate so we could get out of there. Maybe it was a bad day for our server or something but we wanted to love it based on the new twist it brought to tacos. We left and walked to Bakersfield down the street. We may be back if everything else is booked.",2-star
Heard such good things about this place I couldn't wait to try it! Go in and wait to be served...and waited..and waited. Finally grabbed my stuff and got up and left! Service sucks!,1-star
"We chose Condado as the dinner place for my husband's birthday with a couple of his friends because who doesn't love tacos?! We definitely were not disappointed. They don't take reservations so we walked in and the wait was long, but we didn't mind because there was a bar :) In fact, there are two! One downstair and one upstairs; the upstairs one seemed larger. So we left our name and went upstairs and ordered a pitcher of Strawberry Margaritas and their Traditional Jalapeno Guacamole. The pitcher served about 6 glasses and were perfect! Not to sugary or watered down like other places make, but not too strong with the taste of cheap tequila! You could taste both the mix and the alcohol = two thumbs up! The guac was great and smooth and their chips crispy. After who knows how long, we sat down and started our fun journey of building our own tacos with the check list. Two people in our party picked from their pre-selected tacos and the other four built their own. It building your own was overwhleming at first glance, but super exciting as I looked down the list. It is nice to be able to order two different tacos with two different flavor themes! I made one with the beef brisket and a spicy theme (using the other toppings) and the second one with the BBQ jackfruit (they ran out of shrimp ceviche) with a fresh theme. Both turned out AMAZING. A good taco starts from the outside and being able to get a soft AND hard shell ensures you don't miss out on any texture! All the ingedients were great and the two tacos were huge! My husband had to help me finish them! And to think... they were both under $5 each! Everyone enjoyed their food and the service was super friendly but not overbearing. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because our table was sticky, which was annoying as we were there. But, we will definitely be back. Super affordable, delicious, and convenient for all appetites!",4-star
"Condado has fantastic build your own tacos. There are plenty of options, including delicious vegetarian options like marinated portobello and chili tofu. I really enjoy the Sweet Lucy shell which has queso built into it. I recommend ordering the margarita of the month. It's always delicious and creative. The only downside is that this place is packed at all hours. That's because it's so great!",5-star
"Went here after a Penguins game in search of good, unique tacos. Got a dip trio, which comes with two salsas also. Highly recommend the chorizo queso, my dip of choice of the 5. For drinks, my husband got the traditional Marg and I went mango. Yum, although no salt on the rim. I'm sure you could get some if you asked, but that's usually a given for a Marg. When it came to taco time, I wanted to go with ones on the list because I often think the chef knows what meats, Vegis, and sauces pair together best for the ultimate tasty taco. Unfortunately, of the list of about 10 tacos, there was like one chicken and one beef and the rest were vegetarian or vegan friendly with no meat. I'm all for having these options, but carnivores like me want a taco with some substance. I don't know if they'd add meat to the vegan and veg options, but I opted to just create my own instead at that point. I did one with brisket and one with pulled pork. I made sure to add different Vegis, sauces, and shell choices to each so I could sample as much as I could from their list of add ons. I've gotta say, I made two pretty perfect creations. All the ingredients were fresh, my brisket one was my fav. This could be partly due to the fact that after all the dips and taco #1 I had no room for taco #2, so it went home with me and was reheated for lunch the next day. I'd def return, and it was a nice simple walk from PPG Paints for a post-game dinner. But my only suggestion would definitely be to have more suggested tacos including meats.",5-star
"This is a make your own tacos place, that also offers some pre-made tacos. Me and my friends ordered some nachos and two or three tacos each, which ended up being more than enough. If you're only getting tacos I think two or three are fine, based on how hungry you are. They're pretty big and filling. Nachos were nothing special. We had quite a lot left over but didn't box. We mostly just ate the free chips that they gave us, which were good. The tacos were also fine, but again nothing special. It kind of felt like they were going for the authentic but hip vibe with some of their ingredients, and it just didn't end up impressing me. None of the individual ingredients (and I tried to get a variety) were amazing. Just didn't live up to other tacos I've had, growing up in California. All that being said, I see the appeal for make your own tacos and nice drinks in a hip environment at a reasonable price point. Also the murals, art, and service were all awesome!",3-star
"I was in town and was craving mezcal margaritas so we came here. It's eh. Mezcal was good but even when i kept ordering different flavors, i didnt get much flavor. I didnt get to try the food except for the guac and salsa, but my bf tried the tacos. He said they were good. I did like that you can basically create your own taco.",3-star
For New Year's Eve you would expect average service and food at any bar or restaurant. Wrong. This place was awesome. The tacos were amazing and it was 11pm. Drinks were great too. Excited to come back next time I'm in Pittsburgh,5-star
"This place is SO COOL. They have a build your own taco menu, a very extensive liquor menu, & some really good looking cocktails. Whenever you order a margarita, you get to pick the tequila that goes in it! AND they have the tequilas listed by quality! There are a good amount of vegetarian options as well, which is always a plus for me. I ordered one with the Thai chili tofu & one with Portobello mushrooms. Everything was very fresh tasting & their corn tortillas were THE BEST. We also tried their Queso special which was loaded baked potato... it kind of just tasted like potato soup on chips, but it was quite pleasing. The tacos are cheap & the drinks are a decent price for being downtown. I'll definitely be back.",5-star
"Just made it here for the first time and was very impressed. The decor inside is fitting with their theme, but the overall modern layout of Tonic is still there which I like. The service was great and our server took a lot of time to explain all of the options and some of his favorites with us. We had the queso blanco and salsa verde to start. The queso might be the best I have ever had. It was a perfect level of thickness and had a great cheesy taste. The salsa was also very good. It wasn't runny like many salsas can be. The chips they use are house made and you can definitely notice a difference. I had two soft shell flour tacos as my meal. My first was the house made chorizo with cheddar and Mexican chimichurri. The flavor of the chimichurri was great and went perfect with the chorizo. My second taco was the chicken with chipotle crema. The chipotle sauce had a perfect amount of spice to it. Overall I couldn't have been happier with the food here. You can tell everything is fresh and house made which really makes a difference. Can't wait to go back.",5-star
"Love this place so much! Let me get my two negatives outta the way: 1. So effing loud! Full of woo girls 2. They don't use the Nowait app 3. Waiting area is non existent Ok now to the good stuff. The margaritas are so good! I recommend getting a pitcher to share, it's more economical. The guac and queso are killer and the homemade chips always crispy and perfectly salted. The build your own taco scheme is so simple it's genius! You cant go wrong with the shells but I would recommend hard over soft. The juices from the salsas and sauces and meats will make the floor tortilla soggy. I haven't met a meat there that wasn't good. Seriously just go. NOW!",4-star
"Hands down BEST tacos I've ever had in my life. I loved the concept, where you order your own food by using pen and paper. There are tons of options, especially for vegans and vegetarians. Drinks looked great, I ordered one but I think the server forgot to put it in. I ate so much chips and guacamole that I was kind of glad he forgot it! Wow! Check this place out.",4-star
"Condado Tacos is a great restaurant. I've gone 4 times over the past 2 weeks. It's definitely budget friendly, with really tasty suggested tacos, but my favorite is the Create your own tacos. Starting at $3, they allow you to customize your taco from shell to sauce, the whole enchilada. You can easily get away with eating in for $10-$15. The margaritas looked really good too (and cheap), but haven't yet indulged on that yet. Also - they have a loyalty card that's gets you $5 back on every $50 you spend. Happy hour takes a $1 off tacos and Margaritas, so you definitely can't go wrong (5-7PM).",5-star
What a concept - build your own tacos. And they are awesome including the quesos and salsas. Plus some great beers on tap too. This place is always busy but haven't had to wait more than 10 min for a table.,4-star
"I typically never order tacos because I'm picky as all hell, but this place lets you build your own! I met my friend here for lunch last Friday, and it wasn't even our first choice. We tried three other restaurants but they were all packed to the brim. We both mentioned Condado and said we had yet to try it so we might as well give it a try. We got seated right away and even got a seat on their patio area. I consider myself a queso connoisseur and their queso is bomb. Honestly though, the tacos were the best part. I believe I go the ju-ju shell which was essentially a hard shell nestled inside a soft shell glued together with their queso - amazing. Highly recommend.",5-star
"Spicy!!! They need a spice warning for some of these tacos! Anyway, I was a bit disappointed by my experience here. It was extremely crowded and very loud. You are either going to be crammed in downstairs, or crammed in upstairs. They don't really have menus, you use two different sheets of paper to order by checking what you want in pencil. The first sheet has ""suggested"" tacos and the other sheet is a ""create your own"". I decided to get two suggested tacos. You put your name at the top when you are done filling out your sheet. At the table they give you plastic sporks and a roll of paper towels. So messy. The cafeteria style sporks just don't work and feel really cheap to me. Can't invest in some real forks? When it was time to deliver the tacos, the waiter would announce the name and you claim your tacos from the tray. When our table got the tacos, we were all confused about who actually had the right tacos. Mine ended up having meat in it, but nobody at the table ordered meat. Apparently I did by accident. There was a spanish word in the description that I did not understand that apparently meant meat. It was a %#*^ show. The waiter returned with two new tacos, the Dutch Dragon and George's Dirty Taco. I took one bite of the dutch dragon, and my mouth turned to complete fire. It had guac, portobellos, corn, tomatoes, salsa and of course pickled jalapeños. Again, probably my fault, but they really need a spicy warning. I scarfed down the dirty taco, which seemed spicy too, but maybe it was because my mouth was burning. That one had rice, beans, cheese, onions and ""dirty sauce"". I literally don't know what that means but it was a decent taco. So, if you want absolute chaos and a night ending with sticky fingers and a burning mouth, come on down!",2-star
"This actually may be my new favorite taco spot in Pittsburgh. I just really love the vibe. The food is good and the price is right on point with what you should pay for tacos in a Downtown Pittsburgh location. There is a downstairs and upstairs, giving it plenty of space for patrons. You build your own tacos here. You fill out a form of what you want and the quantity you want. They also have a few ""house"" recommended ones on another form you can fill out. Great variety on everything from taco shells, meat, and sauces. You could make a TON of different tacos if you wanted. I had three totally different tacos. I loved them all! We also ordered an order of chips with gauc + two salsas. I think that was actually my favorite part. I lied... the pitcher of peach margaritas was my favorite part. I will be back like 1000 times.",5-star
"Condado is a great addition to what seems to be an ever-expanding taco scene in Pittsburgh. The biggest difference here from other joints is that you can completely customize your tacos. I highly recommend the Sweet Lucy from the taco shell selections! It is a soft shell, layered with cheese and then a hard shell inside...kind of like a gordita crunch for anyone that's a Taco Bell fan. The prices at Condado are also super reasonable. You only pay $3 per taco..unlike some other places in town that charge $6 or $7. They also have a great Happy Hour where tacos are $1 off!",5-star
"Finally, after hearing so much about this place I paid it a visit. The service was dynamite, wish I caught the gents name, but he was a great bartender and really attentive. The margarita is a little too sweet for my taste, but okay nonetheless. Queso with black beans was really good, extremely flavorful. Tacos... Little disappointing. I got the fried corn shell with tofu and wasn't a fan. Tofu was over fried as well as the shell. Obviously it was fresh, but one bite and the whole thing crumbled. Thankfully they give you a spork. Next was the shredded jackfruit, which was decent. I've read reviews where people have said the tacos are really packed with ingredients and totally worth the price, I didn't get that. It wasn't expensive, but they were minimally stuffed. It's a nice, hip place that downtown needed. Really glad to have it. Only downside is that there isn't a lot of room to move. I sat at the bar and had to sit like a T-Rex with my elbows shoved to my side. Oh and it's loud.",4-star
"Fun and friendly taco restaurant Downtown. So many options for customizing orders, can be overwhelming. Honestly, you can't make a bad choice! Highly recommend the flight of Margaritas!!",4-star
Very disappointed. Tortilla chips were way too greasy. Asked for hot salsa and what we got was not only mild but also quite bland. Brisket Tacos were nothing special; had much tastier ones at another place around the corner. It was their first week open so I may give it another shot... have heard some good things that don't match my experience.,2-star
"This place is trying way too hard. Born and raised in LA, I know good Mexican, and this is far from it. The queso is very similar to that of Moe's at three times the cost. Gross. The beef brisket on my taco tasted like marshmallows??? The only redeeming qualities to this meal were the salsa verde and my pomegranate margarita. The decor is...very strange. Meme-y and kind of annoying. ""TACOS 4 LYFE!!!""? Not these tacos. Won't be back for the food. Might be back for the margaritas. If you want good Mexican, walk around the block to Bakersfield.",1-star
"Went to Frys in the same area recently . . . R.I.P., Dark Horse. This place is now Fullers :( Dark Horse was one of the best Dive Bars in Chandler! Used to be a regular hangout for my friends and I on Friday nights. Karaoke, anyone? Always had a great time. My friend is a musician, and she'd come here to sing / play in 2009 when Dark Horse had open mic on Thursday nights. Nice to get local musicians some exposure. Fantastic drink specials; delicious Long Island Iced Teas and a beer on tap for everyone. Will definitely miss this place!",4-star
"The Dark Horse rises! Send out the signal Mr. Commissioner. We shall convene at the bar! Needed a dive to hangout with some friends. I decided to check this place out on a whim and let's just say I did not regret it. Good food and affordable drinks (AA Member here! Affordable Alcohol) I ordered the Rooster Burger, which came with some sport peppers on the side. I love it when my burgers have some kick to it. Grilled onions and Ortega chili a top a cheesy beef patty = yum! My mate and I ordered their bucket of beer, which only came out to $10 for 5 bottles - Shazam! I ain't talking about Shaq either! Live music on a Saturday night. It was a cover band that was rocking it! Sweetness, they dressed up like the early 90's --- big hair and waves haha yep! The place itself appears to be a sports bar. Large LCD screens and a projector screen for the main game. There was a poker game going on at the back of the bar and owners are definitely from SD - Booo! Go Chiefs! - Enjoy",4-star
"What can I say? Nothing good here at all. The wait staff seemed lost. We ordered cheese curds and they gave us a handful. Literally like 10 little pieces for 6$. Wings were ok but nothing to write home about. Very small and cluttered place. Keep driving, zipps or teakwoods would be a far better choice.",1-star
"Great sports bar. Staff is very friendly. Service is fantastic. Jason the bartender one of the best in Chandler. Owner was there during our visit and was very engaging. I didn't try the food but plan to next ime . Overall a clean, friendly neighborhood bar. Couldn't find any glaring negatives whatsoever.",5-star
"I like the wino wednesdays, the pasta bowl was delish and was quite a bit for $5, we also like Thursday for the 38 cent tacos and 2 dollar Tecates. Three tacos filled me up. The wait staff, cook and bartenders can make or break your business, I think the owner has a winning crew Tammy and Diane",5-star
"I went with my SO to this joint last week on a Thursday and I liked it! I thought it would be to dingy for me, but apparently I'm dingy girl! Happy hour til' 9 or 10 BUT reverse happy hour after 11pm. What more could you want? Had too large of a beer for $3, some kick-ass nachos ( kind of $$). Spilled cheese on myself. Don't know if it was me or the beer that caused that. But the clientele there didn't mind. Loud music, breadth of humanity, plenty of seating. Attentive staff. Actually, I think they were trying to get me drunk because they kept coming around and telling me about different drink specials. TV's with sports and goof-sports shows. In all, a great way to make for a difficult Friday at work.",4-star
"We go to DH often for NFL games. It's the best place in the area to watch several games at once....trust me, we have tried several. Food is fair, service if fair, but we will continue to go for NFL and draft beer.",4-star
Nifty little hidden sports bar with great service and great owners.. Owner Lisa is always friendly. Food is better than bar fair & atmosphere is nice. A great local bar. They even have an indoor putting green!,4-star
"What a fantastic bar. The karaoke dude is sorta...well, interesting, but hey. He lets us sing and only mildly judges us. Love the food - hello, Chicago style hot dog - and the drinks are always cold and delicious. I have a favorite football bar but the Dark Horse has specials every day, including happy hour Monday through Sunday. So go. It's fantastic. The inside is nothing fancy but the staff is warm and friendly. They do favor the regulars, but generally...regulars treat the staff better.",4-star
"Ok, let's just forget about the food cuz I only had one thing and it sucked and that's not why I went. So DH gets a free pass on that for now! The first time I went, they had the NHL draft on which I thought was awesome! (Not enough people are into hockey in my opinion!) I was with a bunch of Polar Ice guys so it was a lot of fun. But the REAL reason you go to Dark Horse is definitely for the Karaoke. It's one of the best song selections I've seen-ahem Wings and Rings down the street could maybe take a hint! Good crowd. Wide variety of ""talent"" and the MC Karaoke master is like a guy out of The Wedding Singer but you gotta love him! Service is not the best. They seem to take care of the regulars a little better. Still if you're looking for a good time on a Friday night, I highly recommend!",4-star
"Those who have been lucky enough to stroll into the Dark Horse Sports Bar in Chandler (SE corner of Ray / Rural) have found a real treasure. I know when I came in for the first time, I felt like I had come home. This has become my preferred sports bar to watch the big game and yes I am giving this a sparkling review. The TVs? Just as everyone likes. Flat screens-a-plenty. High-Definition standard. And the premier TV is a giant featuring the game everyone wants to see. NFL Sunday Ticket, ESPN Game Plan, ESPN Full Court, Big Ten Network, MLB Extra Innings, NBA League Pass, Mega March Madness. You name it, theyve got it. Within the first few moments when I stepped in, I saw someone flop the nuts at the Main Event WSOP. Speaking of - Poker Night is hosted every Tuesday. Also for the musically inclined, theres a Rock Band & Karaoke night staged later in the week. Happy Hour specials offer many discounts. And during any football game, its nice to know these specials are always honored. The menu fare - order any entree and you wont leave hungry. I recommend the bacon avacado cheeseburger. The drinks. You will find many beers on tap, all the spirits, and wine. And my greatest sense of comfort with Dark Horse is when I go into my favorite bar & ask for ""the usual"" - they know what I want! My only complaint about the bar, is there is no Ms. Pac-Man tabletop console. Since I am the best player I have ever met at that game, I regrettably cannot leave my unbeatable high score mark at Dark Horse. Where the Longshots are the Favorites.",5-star
"Best steak and eggs in Vegas! It's cheap too - only $6.99. If your waiter doesn't mention, you need to tell him/her that you want to order special steak and eggs. Menu doesn't have it though. I went 3 times in December, enough for the year.",5-star
Great little place with awesome food and excellent beer. Great prices and even won a few bucks in their casino this time. I will always stop here when I come to vegas and visit. Also looking forward to the expansion!,5-star
"This restaurant used to be really good. A few years ago you got price rib, salad, roll, baked potato, and a microbrew for $9.99. Now it's $19.99 without a beer. Quality is lower. Soup hardly lukewarm and overly salty. Service was slow on a Wednesday night. Slots aren't loose anymore, either. I can't rate the rooms, as I've never rd stayed there. But it's no longer my favorite little spot in Vegas, sad to say.",1-star
This is my favorite craft brewery in Las Vegooose. You can't beat the price on craft beer and shots anywhere. The craft beer is so good and so cheap. Come in the next time you are in town. Close of the strip and walking distance to shopping or eating at the Linq.,5-star
"The hotel is very close to the strip and easy in and out by car. Short wait for uber, unlike other bigger hotels. The food is amazing and HUGE portions! The vending machines are located at every floor and cheap! Paulina at the front desk did an awesome job accommodating us as we arrived way too early for the check in. The security guy was also very helpful when we had issues with our safe security lock box. Thank you Ellis Island!",5-star

"Delicious and generous! I ordered chicken fried steak, potatoes and sunny side up eggs. Very tasty! The wait to get into the cafe us one hour plus but, it is well worth it! There is an in house brewery as well!",5-star
GREAT FOOD AND SERVICE. We had a waitress named kate she was the best we had in vegas i give them 5 stars would give them more if i could,5-star
"While the place may turn you off or make you hesitate to go in, the food is FANTASTIC.... and reasonably priced. We have not had a bad meal there yet ! The steak special - yep - just be sure to get your Casino card first. Too bad they don't include the beer or root beer anymore. When we arrive in Vegas, we drop off our bags and walk over to Ellis. I get the steak special and my spouse gets the Shrimp Scampi. Breakfast is great. My only complaint would be sometimes it is slow getting the food to you. We found this place because the Locals all praised it.",5-star
This is a great place to stop in and get casual food for the price. 4 of us ordered 3 dishes (kids shared pasta) and it all came to just $31. You can't beat the price. Lucy our server was amazing!! So friendly. I would eat here again.,4-star
"I only have a few moments to tell you how horrible this place is. We first came in and were treated so rudely by the host. Then we finally escorted to our table that was only big enough to accommodate a party of 4, and when we asked to change tables the waitress told us to basically make it work with our party of 6. Then we waited 45 mins to get our food only to find out that I was horrible. My friends steak was still bleeding when she got it and when we asked to have it replaced, they basically threw it back on the grill only to burn it and still charged us for it lol. The only good thing about this place is phi the waiter. He is the nicest person ever and i wish him the best because he won't get it here. This place sucks!!!!!!!",1-star

"Las Vegas. So many places to eat and so little time. You want to try everything you seen on the strip and can't wait to tell you friends about it. This place is the one spot you did not know existed, but wished you did a lot sooner. Ellis island is just one block off the strip on koval (that funny street you take to avoid the traffic on the strip). This place has the best BBQ for the price anywhere in Nevada. It is a locals favorite, and I can see why. Right price, great food, and great service (specifically from a man who understands the customer). The place is very clean. You wouldn't expect it from looking outside the casino and the average customer, but this will not let you down. I am in my 20's and this spot would be attracting more people if it was on the strip. Why not 5 stars, because it isn't the best BBQ. However, for the price and the amazing taste, it's damn near close. Definitely worth the trip off the strip.",4-star
"Horrible service and the food is hit and miss. The only plus is the good is cheap, the downfall is u receive crappy service from low life waitresses who I doubt even finished junior high. This dump used to be fun but lately it seems like there's new management or something because everything has gone down the drain including the service.",1-star

"Never got to eat here. Went here with 13 people and they said they could not accommodate us. They said they are used to a maximum of 8 people only. We spoke with the manager and she said the same thing in a nicer way. This place was half full many empty tables but the couldn't help us. They said they could not guarantee our food would come out at the same time, or even that we could sit at the same table. Let alone in the same area. It was ridiculous. But it should be expected from a shabby place like this off the strip. This is the first time i have been disappointed after checking yelp. I recommend u don't go with a big group. Terrible for groups.",1-star

"I love this place! It is much harder to get over here now that I have kids. Some people look at this hidden gem nestled into the Super 8 motel as some dingy little casino. I see it as one of the best deals close to the strip. This is are ""go to"" place when we have guests in town. I think it's funny when you are driving through the parking lot there is a sign that have the beer price and you can tell it's been changed many times. I always joke with people that their beer prices are like the stock market. First let me talk about the beer. They are pretty standard, Amber, IPA, Stout. and you also have a root beer. The beer isn't special but its a craft like beer that is cheap. When you spend $12 on the strip for a 12oz corona you learn to appreciate this place. They have a little lounge in the corner that has karaoke. Let me warn you though, it does tend to get pretty smokey on the weekends. Also, every time I have been in the lounge there has been a homeless guy sitting at the bar. Or, he might have been a truck driver. Either way Ellis Island is for everyone! It's not some secret hipster bar that serves strange drinks. I always heard about the food here. We have only eaten here a couple times. Is the food incredible? Not really, but it's cheap and pretty good. You can get a steak and beer at a really great price. So, if you are in the area or neighborhood check this place out. Cheers!",4-star
I love this place! we all know what a dive bar is but a dive casino! Who would of ever thought. $2 20oz pints of their beer and its tasty! Free $15 slot pay upon sign up.,5-star
"I recommend EI for locals and tourists that are seeking a genuinely FUN night! Inexpensive drinks, great pizza, small comfortable atmosphere, and most importantly, the Karaoke! Extensive song selections, supportive crowd, it's like home. Plus there are frequent visits from local celebrities like Joey Fatone! :)",5-star
"We travel often to Vegas every year; this is the place we most look forward to visiting - for the food, the people and the gambling. The steak and eggs special is the best in Las Vegas and the service has always been fantastic. Every steak we've ever ordered rivals that of a more upscale Ruth Chris - you simply won't get a better deal. The BBQ special is always packed, and Metro pizza for 3 bucks a slice while playing the slots is a snack worth getting. Let the karaoke singers serenade you while you partake of the vice of your choice - it's totally entertaining!",5-star
"Heard about this from a friend. So went in w/ an open mind. Walked into an old and dirty casino. Place looked like it was built in the 70's. We were told by the hostess the wait was an hour. Load of people were there. Always a good sign. So we hung out and had one of their local beers. Was really good. Turns out they have won national awards for the beer brewed on site. Impressive. Finally called our number. We were led into a old school steak house. As some described it, a scene from Godfather or Goodfellas. Place was dark. Carpet walls and tables all seemed to be colored dark brown. Seating was also retro. Ordered the house special, prime rib with potatoes. Came w/ soup or salad. Most importantly, came w/ a free beer. All for $13. First time I tried it w/ a party of 13. Second time w/ a party of 5. Third w/ a party of 5. And everyone loved the prime rib. At times a medium comes out well done. Occasionally vice versa, but mention it to the wait staff and they'll bring you another. Great food for the price. And one of the best prime rib dinners I've had.",4-star
"As many times as I have gone to Las Vegas the last few years, I never managed to make time to stop at Ellis Island but this time, my friends and I made the effort before hitting the road back to LA to stop for dinner...and by far has this place topped our dining options over any other place in Vegas. Located a few blocks away from the main strip, the gaming and dining area is fairly crowded. Below are my pros and cons about this restaurant...with my overall review at the bottom... Pros - most delicious ribs EVER with mouth-watering beans/corn - large portions bang for the buck - fun atmosphere--very ""back in the days"" like theme of Vegas Cons - small dining area--should be bigger for the amount of people that visit there - disorganized call-waiting system...the casino's fairly loud with all the machine noises going on...should have something better... - gotta wait a long time before they can seat you...esp for a group of six or more Overall If I had more time next time and didn't have to rush (time not being a factor), I would go for sure. Great choice! =)",4-star
"We went here on our last day for some Breakfast. I was under the impression that you can get a Steak and Eggs Breakfast for under $4.99, but that is only offered between 11pm- 6am. Regardless, the place has pretty Good food and the Service is Friendly. Grace our Server, was very Friendly and very Comedic. The place is a Casino, but also has a BBQ restaurant and a Karaoke bar. We started off with Coffee and Fresh squeezed Orange juice. We mostly ordered the Corn Beef Hash and Eggs with Potatoes for $5.99. The in-laws ordered the Short stack Buttermilk for $3.99. My Brother ordered the Italian Sausage which was a little ""Spicy"". All the food came out pretty quick, and as I mentioned before; it was very Good. There are Daily Specials like Asian Night on Thursday and Italian Night where they offer specific Menu choices and Themes. I was happy I got a chance to try out their Breakfast, but will look forward to try some of their other Menu items.",4-star
"Hm.. I couldn't help reading all the reviews of $6.99 top sirloin steak (with baked potato, green beans and root beer) so I had to try this out. Steak was hmm.. quality you'd get at costco (by the way, no matter how you order it, it comes out the same way), baked potato and beans you'd also be able to get at costco and the root beer was one of the highlights. It isn't carbonated and room temperature. My guess is that they brewed it themselves (they're supposed to be the #1 microbrewery in NV). Personally, I liked the root beer and they put it in a beer glass so you don't look like you're wimping out. Place is a bit ehhhh, the place is just called ""restaurant"" (straight ahead of the entrance and oh yeah... $6.99 deal is not on the menu.. just ask for it) and service is HORRIBLE. All in all... don't expect fancy or unique... just good value and cheap!",4-star
"great prime rib for an affordable price! taxied to ellis island on an empty stomach for a late lunch, but encountered a delay caused by the wait in the restaurant. the hostess said the wait would be approximately 45 mins, but we were seated within 25- 30 mins. i ordered the prime rib that came with the salad, root beer, mash potatoes and string beans. everything was so heavenly. AH! i was really glad my sister recommended this place to eat in LV. the place does look a tad bit shabby, since its not a renovating casino, with a modern outlook, but that's alright, because the food makes up for it! it's nice knowing this place is 24/7, so totally great for after hour eats. definitely coming back when i want some good prime rib without the excessive price. FYI: taxis don't swing by this location very often, so we had to go the help desk to call for a taxi. when our taxi came, another group attacked the car and stole it from us! so we had to tell the workers again. wasn't so bad since the taxis were prompt.",4-star
"After a long night of clubbing, we were up for some breakfast at 4am. While hailing a taxi cab, our attendant convinced us to go to this place (instead of another we had in mind). Big Joe told us it was the best place to get some steak and eggs. Well Big Joe, you were wrong. Granted, the food was decent. The eggs weren't dry, and with a little salt and pepper, it made it just right. Potato pieces always a plus. I ordered my steak medium rare, which usually let's my meat be just the right texture - not too dry, and not too bloody. Well, my meat was a bit on the dry side, so one can only imagine if I had even fathomed to order my meat well done. Then again, you get what you pay for. My main complaint about this place was the service we received. After a long wait to get our food (maybe I'm too used to the fast service I get in California?), we finished our food, and waited for the check. I guess I'm used to getting the check before I'm done eating. But we waited. And waited....................... AND WAITED. We tried asking the hostess for the check, but she just rudely stated she didn't know who our server was, and she simply couldn't help us. From what I could see, there were only two servers at the time, so how hard was it to figure it out. If the first one said no, THEN ASK THE OTHER! And yes, we did try to get our waiter's attention. Luck had it that he was serving two large groups. However, that is not an excuse for a good 30 minute long wait (or at least what felt like 30 minutes) for our check. Ready to go to sleep, exhausted from a night of clubbing and suffering from a food coma, we decided to do the right thing and leave money on the table before we left. Yes, that's right, we never got our check. At least we had the decency to leave money for our meal. I know we could've just walked out and left, but we took the high road. Well, except for leaving this one star review that is.",1-star

"Absolutely love this place! I go here for Drag Events and I've never been disappointed cover is cheaper on a normal night before 11 I think? Multiple floors to dance and hang out in, love the staff and they play GREAT music. All sorts of dance music from various years!! If anything, definitely check it out for the interior, one of the coolest places I've ever been inside!",5-star
"The service at times is deplorable and some of the security personnel are unnecessarily aggressive. I have been going to fly for years, and always had a great Time. Unfortunately, there have been times when I have waited to purchase a drink for about 20 minutes. Other times, I found that some of the bar tenders in the glass room were rude. I will most likely still go to fly, but not as frequently, and I will definitely not purchase any drinks. My last visit was very disappointing, and made it apparent to me that customer service is not one of their top priorities.",2-star
"Great party!!! If you're looking for a huge club feel, then this is it. I came on Saturday and I had a great time. We actually came early and the bouncer and ticket guy were super friendly. Told us to come back when it was busier and gave us a $5off coupon so we could keep the $10 admission. Most club workers aren't that friendly at all. I highly recommend this place. It was great!",5-star
"Lets be serious unless you are on E, MDMA or Coke this place isn't that great. The venue is amazing which is why I have rated it as high as I did. The cover is outrageously high, the music is sub par to say the least and the men are ok to look at but you know they are all tripping out on something. As a person who does not do drugs, I do not get the appeal of Fly. Also, they have too many themed nights, so if you do not research it before hand you may be a ethnic minority that evening. Save your $20.00 cover and use it towards 3 drinks at another bar!",3-star
"The atmosphere in this place is amazing, making it perfect for a date (it's kinda hard to find cute date spots sometimes!) The drinks are nice and the tables & decor are delightfully unique - it's all exposed piping, wood and concrete. It can run a little expensive, but the service is excellent and the cocktails are tasty enough to warrant the price. It can get a bit loud at night, especially as it's basically in the centre of a bunch of offices (including mine!) and most of the patrons are suited-up business types who seem to come here a lot. It's extra amazing in summer when the terrace comes out and you can sit in the shade of an old church!",5-star
"I felt famous and anonymous all at the same time. The entrance was hidden behind a dumpster. The doorman was talking to himself in secret. All of these things are true. I met a group of friends here for drinks and dinner - and it was so packed and so loud that even though it took forever for my drink to come, I didn't dare venture to the bar to harass anyone because I easn't even sure I was cool enough to be there. No, kidding, I was cool! The food - I had raw oysters and my partner had an epic seafood chowder packed with tasty stuff. The prices were up there (about $25 for the chowder), but we seriously enjoyed ourselves. I'd splurge there again, for sure. I think I might go back on an off night next time, though - not because of the noise (it was very loud BUT they were playing great music all eve) - just simply to avoid choking on so much cologne/perfume while trying to eat, and, you know, breathe. The crowd was putting on all the chemical romance the last time I was in - gotta love a Montreal Friday night.",4-star
"With the exception of its semi sketchy location, Furco is one of my favourite bars in town. I especially enjoy the fact that it attracts an older and more professional crowd. The bar itself is relatively spacious and there's quite a bit of seating. With that said, it fills up quickly on weekends, so if you arrive too late it's hard to find somewhere to sit. Another thing that I find bizarre is that the employees sometimes try to force you into paying for coat check when it's not necessary. If you manage to find seats, it's really easy to enjoy yourself here. The service is great and always very professional. The drink selection is fairly decent, but prices are a bit on the more expensive side. They also have a pretty good menu if you get hungry or want something to eat. One thing I'd like to mention is that the music is extremely loud, so you're in a room full of people essentially yelling at each other over it. Another thing is that there's no dance floor, which can be a tease because the music selection tends to be quite good. Other than that, Furco is great!",4-star
"Went to the Furco on a Tuesday evening with my co-workers for a networking get together, and it couldn't have been a better setting. The lightings were perfect, it gives the whole place a very cozy atmosphere. We had platters of charcuterie, cheese, smoked salmon rillettes, green salad, olives and walnuts. I've tried their #1 and #3 cocktails and everything tasted very good. The service was perfect, the waitress was very attentive. Definitely a great place for a 5@7!",4-star
"I just stopped by this place for the first time tonight. It was recommended by their neighbors at Café Parvis next door (where I had lunch!). Furco is a nice little joint in a still rustic sandblasted concrete ground floor of larger building. It has a beautiful serpentine bar that encourages strangers to sit next to one another and while they eat and drink. It has tables too, but the bar seems like the center, rather than the edge, of the action. I am currently on a no-alcohol bit, and that didn't stop the bartender form offering me an incredible cocktail of crushed cucumber and a kind of peppery homemade syrup that was absolutely delicious. Not on the menu, but order it if you're going alcohol-free. It's great. I had the tartare de boeuf (steak tartare) and it was extraordinary. At the center was a lovely mix of healthy veggies stacked into a rectangular form, and layered on top of a wonderful sauce, with the tartare in three piles at the edges. The requisite crusty bread was there too, and the gustatory delight was on. Delicious. The staff were very friendly and paid attention to this solitary guest. A very nice small meal at a very fair price.",5-star
"Montreal at its best ! We showed up around 10:30 pm on a Saturday night ! Place was packed ( but not uncomfortable packed ) ; music was ""right on"" ; staff courteous and professional ; drinks delicious .... Try the Rye and Basil martini if you are into that... Different and tangy. Last but not least ... A very nice mix of a crowd... Recognized a few that also see at Pourquoi Pas Espresso cafe on Amherst .... Just a really nice crowd . Hope the place stays open for a long time !",4-star
"I've been here a number of times at various times of day. For me it's a laid back mid-afternoon hang out place, a fun pre-evening starting point and a crowded & exciting night spot. I like Furco for its versatility and convenience. The food and drinks are great - not out of this world - but I go here to socialize more than to eat/drink. It's great to have a flexible gathering spot like this in Montreal. Since it is not in the main-drag areas of downtown, it contains more locals and people that seek it out as opposed to tourists stumbling upon it. Because if you don't know it exists and you don't know this city, trust me - you wont stumble upon Furco by accident. Will I be back again? Probably, I always am at some point.",3-star
"Food was not bad, the atmosphere was nice. One of the bartenders was soo sad and since I was on the bar it felt like she wanted to cry for a whole hour. The price wasn't cheap or expensive but it wasn't cheap for sure. What i felt I paid for food wasn't enough in quantity although it tasted very nice. What aucks was that if you site on the other side of the bar u keep getting knocked in the back by people passing by.",3-star
"Furco maintains a sophisticated, upscale mood thanks in part to its glass-laden interior and classy decor. It has some of the 'frozen in time' appeal of Bars Sans Nom (The Emerald) but with a slightly more modern interior. There's definitely something special about Furco that is hard to pinpoint. Service is neither fast nor slow. Staff are French but comfortably bilingual (and without any attitude). Furco is described as a wine bar and this is certainly where they shine. Their staff is consistently knowledgable with regards to their wine menu and can offer great suggestions. However, their bartenders are equally skilled and make very good, strong cocktails ($10+ but worth it). I can't comment on the food (who goes to Furco for fries?), but the ambience and experience is well worth the crowds. The only downside is, of course, the noise levels. This can make nuanced conversation a little bit difficult, but Furco is more suited to a classy night out than meeting with your lawyer/accountant to discuss a merger.",5-star
"Ah Furco ... entre restaurant hype, bar hype et discothèque ... trop de hype, tue le hype. Je m'explique, entre vouloir tout faire, on ne fait rien du tout ... c'est un endroit assez étrange avec de la musique boom boom à fond les ballons, mais sans place pour danser, entre les gens qui restent debout un verre à la main et ceux qui s'assoit pour manger une salade ""hype"" ... moké. On met 2 étoiles pour l'effort ... pas de choix au niveau de la boisson, mais on y sert de la bière correcte. Coté nourriture, on sert des corbeilles de frite assez classique mais efficaces ou des trucs bizarres comme la salade de betterave que j'ai choisie, assez originale, car la betterave était coupée juste en 4, mouais, donc à toi de la couper, et puis dedans on y retrouvais des noisettes, du radis, et du chèvre à l'érable ... alors le chèvre, oui, je sais qu'ici ça coute cher le bon fromage, mais là, le peu que l'on puisse trouver dans l'assiette est en fait étalé sur un bord de l'assiette, à vous d'en récupérer avec vos gros morceaux de betteraves, et bien évidemment ce n'est pas assez bien proportionné pour une salade de betterave au chèvre ... par contre le reste des ingrédients n'avaient pas l'air d'être logique, c'est un peu comme si le chef venait d'improviser pour se la jouer justement ""hype"". La clientèle ? superficielle, comme le lieu. Avec la musique à fond, on ne s'entend pas parler. La boisson bof, mais à des prix un peu élevé par rapport à la qualité. Donc non merci.",2-star

"Is this a lawyer bar? It struck me as a lawyer bar. I intend no disrespect by asking the question. I'm a recovering lawyer. The vibe, clientele and setting struck me as a bar frequented by professional types (lawyers, business folks, etc.). Perhaps the floor-to-ceiling glass and smart bar had something to do with the feeling. Is this bar in the financial district? Business district? FUR district? There's a fur district? Really? Oh, Canada... Once I got a slight sense of my bearings, I got to the business of drinking... which is why I was here. The Yelp category may read 'wine bar' but my cocktail needs were quite well attended. Having gotten back on an Old Fashioned kick the night before, I decided to order one. There wasn't much of a twist to the prep, but the taste was familiar, the drink was strong and the experience was solid. Again, I came in expecting to be overrun with francophones giving me sideyes for my franglais. Nope. The bar staff was quite comfortably bilingual and everyone I encountered was quite nice. In fact, may I say, they were lovely. My friend ordered a Moscow Mule and was quite taken with her beverage. From my experience, I would say that the bar caters more to ladies. The bartenders were all guys and quite chatty with the female patrons... who were vying for their attention. I suppose guys could come here in search of the halo effect... but that's never a good look to/for anyone. Have some self-respect. Come here for a buttoned-up classic cocktail (or, glass of wine) in a respectable, grown-up setting.",4-star
"LOKI ALERT! Went to Furco one night after failing to find my friends during Jazz Fest and ended up with something better. There was a bartender here who looked like the blond version of Tom Hiddleston. Now if he would only speak with a British accent, that would be perfect. My friends and I were too focused on comparing his facial features with pictures of Tom Hiddleston that we forgot to ask for his name. I was surprised this place was actually so busy at night, on a Sunday. Don't know if Montreal-ers are just hardcore drinkers or Furco was just really good. This place is tucked away in a quiet small street. and looked quite charming. I wanted a raspberry white chocolate cake but their kitchen was closed. I ended up ordering a cosmopolitan. I'm definitely coming back here again to try out their food and the cake that got away. For those of you who want to check out a celebrity look alike, you should probably check out Furco too!",5-star

"I can sum this place up very quickly. Crap, with over priced, watered down drinks. I've seen molasses drip quicker in the middle of winter than I was served at this wannabe bar. I joined my wife and two other friends for drinks. They had been there about 20 minutes when I arrived. I sat down and waited to place my drink order (theirs was almost finished). I then waited and waited and waited and waited and waited and...... I did watch the barman hit on a table of women, while I waived my hand frantically to get his attention. Even standing at the bar didn't seem to phase him to much. Then, when I thought he was going to come to the bar to serve me, he actually went to another table to talk to women. I went back to my table and was about to tell my party we should leave when finally someone came by. Apparently ordering a drink from them was them doing me a favor. The person didn't even ask if anyone else wanted refills. When I finally got my beer, about 5 minutes after ordering it, the rest of my table tried to order, but once again, it seemed like the waiter was doing us a favor. We finished our drinks and quickly left. Looking forward to seeing this place shut down. Absolutely worst experience in a bar in a long, long time. The tip reflected what I thought of the service. 1 cent was left.",1-star

"Went to Furco with my Happy Hour buddy on a Friday evening and we were pleasantly surprised to see how full this place was. Don't get me wrong, nothing like a Thursday night where you can barely walk in the place, but as opposed to other Fridays where we've been there in the past, the bars and all the tables were occupied. Cozy and relax atmosphere, always new finger food plates to share, and our barmaid (Sarah) always on the lookout for us. What else can we ask for!?!",4-star

Et les choix de bouffe et de vins, pas comparables à celle d'une grande table, certes, restent plutôt satisfaisants, voire même très intéressants. Le seul plat goûté était les rouleaux de printemps au canard et c'était vraiment très bien, Rien de préfabriqué là-dedans, frais, goûteux, des garnitures originales. Bon choix de bières en fût et de vins au verre, tous en importation privée. Les prix sont très corrects. Belle trouvaille! Au centre-ville, ce genre d'endroit est rare je crois. J'y retourne.",4-star
"The look and feel also reminds me of Philémon bar in the Old Port. A lot of my friends were turned off as the music was much too loud.

Trendy & boisterous...And if all of that is your ideal description, then Furco will provide a heck of a night.",4-star

"I think that my visit to Furco was tainted by it's own success. I headed there with a bunch of colleagues just before 5, hoping to beat the 5pm rush, and arrived to find a lineup. It moved quickly enough, but once we were inside we understood why there was a lineup . . . wall to wall people, everywhere! It felt like it was 10pm, not 5pm, it was such a happening spot! Which is great if that's the vibe you're going for, but for me at 5pm I just want to relax and have a few drinks, not feel strangers bums hitting my own bum, while yelling into the ears of my drinking buddies to be heard. The staff was a mixed bag, the bartenders seemed to love the energy, and were energetic and happy. One waitress in particular was really not feeling it, and was pushy to the point of nearly knocking people over. However all that being said, it was quite nice for such a packed and happening place. Ordering an old fashioned rewarded me with a smile from the bartender, and I was delighted to see it served with an orange peel curl. It was nice and strong as well. An interesting mix of people, some older, some younger, a lot of suits. It provided a lot of good people watching opportunities. The decor was hit and miss. I know a lot of people enjoy the industrial meets polished look, and I do too. But I found that the industrial part was a bit too unpolished for me. Insulation poking out from between the windows? Eeeeek. But the lights, the bar, the furniture, all top notch. The food looked (and smelled) really good. I would be interested to return on a less busy day to order a few dishes to share.",3-star
"With the soap container were replaced with ketchup bottled, the bathrooms were quite nice. There are 3 bathrooms : men, women and both : ) If you get bored of washing your hands the conventional way, there is the giant water fountain to clean your hands that is reminiscent of a school time when everyone used to wash their hands together. The crowd was mid 20's to 30's, it was a good looking variety of men, mainly French men, lots of French friendly men, enthusiastic happy bunch of people. More men than women My friends told me the drinks were great and the price was reasonable. Maybe it was the youthful decor but this place reminded of the high school spirit without the awkwardness that I always felt being labelled as a nerd. Nerds are considered cool over here. A quick tip: get there before midnight or you will get caught in the line.",5-star
I heard so many good things about this place and was so disappointed. The crowd was super lame; a buncha trust fund babies comparing their over the top designer purses and girls that tried to look like they fell out of a sex and the city episode.

"Visited Montreal for New Years & to enjoy incredibly cold weather and we were rewarded with a tip about this place by the staff at Le Filet. The execution of the decor alone demands significant respect.

The beer selection is top notch. Cocktail list is extensive and well executed. The food also, highly enjoyable.",5-star
"Managed to check this place out properly with the darling Helen and her mustachioed man. Arriving at 4:45 I had my pick of seating and chose a comfy bench tucked behind the bar. Service was friendly, not rushed but not at all slow, French but comfortably bilingual. With several affordable and tasty wine options by the glass, and super delicious fresh tartare, attractive lighting and lovely, deceptive use of mirrors and levels this space achieves the romantic out-of-time feeling I love most in bars. After 5:30 the vibe was decidedly after-work and the crowd older than I'm used to up in the mile end. We joked that these folks were trying to pick up and close deals and unearth state secrets all in one 5a7. Pretty enjoyable for what it is, I'd come back again when I am in the area before 5pm, or with a reservation, or when the initial buzz dies down making this joint less oh so uber trendsky. I am definitely happy to have Furco here though, it's part of a happy uptick in tasty non-skeez downtown night life and a great use of space in the too-long sketchy and mostly empty old fur district.",5-star
"Only food I've had is the wings. I've searched far and wide and these wings are the best. Big and cooked correctly. My only complaint would be that since the make their own sauce, the heat factor varies greatly so I've learned to get sauce on the side. I like hot but at times their hot is can remove paint off a rusted Ford. Other times, it isn't even mild. So just order sauce on the side and if you don't like, just get a different sauce.

"A nice, friendly sports bar in a strip mall. The three big screen TV's at the bar are far enough away from the bar so that the viewing is top notch. I don't think they had HD, so that might be the only upgrade needed. The food (especially the onion rings) looked pretty good coming out, but I took advantage of the free appetizer when you check in deal and ended up with a fairly normal rendition of the good ole potato skins. Happy Hour is from 11-7 every day which is pretty amazing for a bar and large domestics are only $3.50. Crowd is mostly related to the area it is located in, but a friendly staff and patrons and a small outdoor patio as well. On this note, Arizona lost and most of the bar left unhappy, but hey we are in Sun Devil country, so tough break.",4-star

"I'd give it a 3 because the food was good but the slow incompetent service dragged it down from ""A-OK"". We went on a late Saturday afternoon. It was pretty dead. Maybe 20 people. Typical sports bar. There were tons of TVs with varying sports represented. We wanted to watch the hockey playoffs. I guess we were the only ones because none of the TVs had it on. Our waitress was friendly, young and, i think new, because when we ordered margaritas she said they had both the ""frozen kind in a machine and the kind you mix"". When we ordered the frozen she brought back the ""on-the-rocks kind"" and said the machine was broken. The drinks were bland and had no discernible alcohol in them. There was a smattering of salt falling off the soda glass they served it in. So deduct points for the inability for the bartender to make AZ's state drink. Each time she walked away it was a good 10 minutes before we saw her again. So we returned the drinks and got beer. Can't screw that up. She was able to get the hockey game on one of the screens for us. So kudos for that. We ordered pizza and wings. You can only get small personal pizzas. Mine had 4 pepperonis. Yay! But it was good with a home made crust. The wings were excellent! Large and in charge. Perfect hotness for mediums. Worth the 25 minute wait. Finally we asked for a couple boxes for left overs. After 10 minutes she brought back only one. We said we asked for 2. After 10 minutes she brought the other one. After 10 minutes she brought the check. After 10 minutes she picked up the check. So if you have a couple hours to kill and the patience of a saint, you just might have a good time!",2-star

"My group of about 8 people stopped in here on a dead Friday night. We were looking to grab a bite to eat and get some drinks. There was practically nobody in the bar so we thought the waitress would welcome some business. Apparently we were wrong. She was rude right off the bat, pissed because we pushed 3 empty tables together. Then we asked if she could split the checks and she said yes, but she couldn't guarantee she would get everyone's order right and we would have to live with it. What? It took her 10 minutes to even come and take our order, then another 15 minutes to get us the drinks. We left after 1 drink because she was so rude and unwelcoming. Which is her loss because I'm sure she would have made at least $50 in tips off of our table. I don't know if she was having a bad night or if she was upset because she had just realized how bad her bleached blonde mullet looked, but either way it was unacceptable.",1-star
"We have a group that meets monthly and have been to George & Dragon II one other time so we felt safe going back, but this time was like day and night. We got there early because we planned on having a dozen or so people there on a Friday evening, and there was a larger party in the back room. The other half of the room was empty so we asked to sit there. The waitress agreed so we took a seat. We asked for drinks which took a few minutes. Two friends came after we got our initial round, and they were ignored. The waitress seemed to be more interested in the larger group with the bigger tip. Part of our meeting dealt with being online since we're a technology education group, and we were blown off. Finally we were told that they no longer have wireless (which they use to ""share"" with the hotel next door). This was really annoying, but we weren't offered any excuses or apologies. We put away our laptops and prepared to enjoy an evening of drinks and dinner. After an hour of literally not getting served (drinks or food), we waited for a table to open in the front. A few of our people were annoyed and left without ordering anything and another person was told not to bother coming. We finally got a booth out front and complained to the waitress there. She said the next round was on the manager, who she supposedly told about our unhappiness (but unsurprisingly, he never came over at all to talk to us). We got our free drinks and two of us who were famished were able to eat. As soon as we were done eating, we got out of there and parted from the bust of an evening. We quickly removed George and Dragon II from our rotation of places for this meeting. From the fact this is has become a dive bar (absolutely NOTHING like the AWESOME George and Dragon I on Central), that the wait staff mostly sucks, and that they don't seem to care about customers, we are completely done with this place. DO NOT GO HERE.",1-star
A great place to get a drink (recommending the Strongbow Cider or Four Peaks Kiltlifter on tap) with friends. Food is very good. The usual bartender on the weekend nights knows her alcohol and can recommend beers based off of what you currently enjoy.,4-star
"I lunch here frequently. It's close to my office. G'n'D (as I call it) has a great menu. It's full of fatty, indulgent British fare. Their prices used to be rediculously low but recently they updated the menu to reflect inflation for the last 20 years. The wait staff is super friendly. I wouldn't hang out at the G'n'D on a Friday night, but for a lunch break I like it.",3-star
"A popular lunch spot with the local businesses, the G&D II offers pseudo authentic English food at a very fair price. Most of the edible offerings are reasonably good (although being an ex pat Brit my standards for this kind of dish are probably higher than some), the service is friendly if rather amateur at times (I have experienced waitresses not knowing what mint sauce is when I ask for it). Another benefit is they are always willing to do separate checks. A spin off from the original G&D on Central Ave, the decor will never be as 'pub like' due to the nature of the building itself, but a fair effort has been made to capture the feeling of a UK pub.",3-star
"We are self-acknowledged beer snobs from the micro brewery capitol of the Pacific Northwest. Goldwater Brewing Co. would stand up against any PNW brewery any day. We loved all the beers in our flight. The Hop Chowda is the only hazy IPA in AZ that we've tried that is on par, or better, than the PNW hazies. Great brewery! Give it a visit if you're in Scottsdale. You will not be disappointed.",5-star
"Had a great time here with a few friends and enjoyed some excellent beers. I made us a reservation for the Goldmine Underground Barrel and Tap Room, and we loved it! The bartender was very knowledgeable and took great care of us. We sampled all of the beers and thoroughly enjoyed them all. Looking forward to coming back again soon.",5-star
"Great beet, good service and I love that they have so many seating options: under ground, patio, beer garden, inside or rooftop!",5-star
"This place rocks! The music is great, the beers are great (specifically the Hop Chowda), and Goldwater has the BEST vibes!",5-star
"Beer is good. Selection is constantly moving and experimental. It is a gem in the microbrewery scene in Arizona. The down side is you don't want to end up being served by the girl in glasses and greasy looking hair. If you're served by anyone else, this is 5 stars.",3-star
"This place does have some good beers. However, they keep raising their prices and have now reached the tipping point with me. There are lots of really great local breweries around town to choose from. I'll be making a conscious effort to spread my business around elsewhere.",4-star
"I enjoyed checking out Goldwater Brewing for the first time, as I do like checking out as many breweries as I can while I travel. We sat up at the bar to enjoy a flight and was helped out with our selections by the bartender. There were probably about 20 beers to choose from, which is always nice to see a good spread. They also seemed to cover most of the styles, providing a lot of variety when picking out some beers to try. A nice large menu. I will say I just didn't really find a beer I liked. We ordered a full flight, as well as trying a couple tastes of some other beers. The server was very helpful in assisting us and checking in on us, I just wasn't feeling that excited over any of the beers. Maybe I just picked the wrong ones, which sometimes happens. I will say that their award winner beer isn't a style that I like, so there was that not working for me but nothing I would knock this place down for. Instead, a huge high five to you for an award-winning beer! The place is small and there were plenty of locals hanging around. I can definitely see this being a place that locals would enjoy... just not quite my vibe.",3-star
"Solid brewery Desert Rose Cactus Ale - really sour and tart at first, but as you drink it, the sweetness comes through. It's also gorgeous!!! What a hue Man their IPAs are ABV heavy hitters. the 24k Imperial IPA boasts a 9.2 ABV. Many other IPAs all really good and smooth Bartender had a little fiery curt attitude with the way she talked. Had to ask her 100 questions and she would never explain anything.. but she kinda become nicer later Overall, good brewery, prices were higher than most breweries I've been to, but free jalapeno popcorn is yours for the taking",4-star
The owner is awesome! Sat next to him on a flight and hit up the brewery on a trip to scottsdale. Great family owned brewery ran with passion and definitely deserving of local support! The pink beer is one of a kind- a must try!,5-star
"Came here with an old buddy of mine on a Saturday evening, and definitely was not disappointed. The place is one of the more relaxed ones in old town Scottsdale, and I definitely mean that in a good way. Their Desert Rose Cactus Ale is perfect for the summer weather in Arizona, and is perfectly brewed and is very refreshing. Need to try their other ones too!",5-star
Pricey brewery in Scottsdale ordered the hop chowda New England India Pale Ale beer is alright nothing wrong but also nothing amazing just ok compared to India Pale ale from Stone Brewing in San Diego Overall not the best value,3-star
"Beer was above average but nothing to rave about. Had about 7-8 beers on draft. Inside is small and kind of cramped, but if you go around the building they have a nice rooftop seating area that was very nice to enjoy the weather. Right on the Scottsdale strip, definitely a place to check out.",4-star
"We are a big fan. This is a great little brewery right on the edge of Old Town Scottsdale. They have really good beer. It is a little small, and the balcony is loud with machinery, but it's fun. The beer is good enough that it makes up for the other stuff. I wish that they bottled their beer.",5-star
"This place is super cool. Lots of different areas to sit. We sat at the bar for a bit, then moved outside. They have barrel aged basement downstairs which sells barrel aged versions of their beer. Upstairs patio was cool too. Free popcorn too!",5-star
"I like that you can order 5, 10 and 16 ounces depending on your interest. One of the employees took us on a mini tour of the brewery. They have a bar set up in the basement with the kegs. Personally not a big fan of beer, but I would come back. PS: They only serve beer (and water), no food.",5-star
"Knew this would be our first stop once we got into Scottsdale and it didn't disappoint. I love the vibe of this place. They have great music on, free popcorn, and the beer is incredible. We started off with a flight and my two favorites were the 24K and the Desert Rose. The staff was friendly and it's a place you can stay for as little or as long as you want and feel welcome.",5-star
"Love this place! Finding new breweries has become something I really enjoy doing and Goldwater was this weekend's spot. The atmosphere is everything I love in a brewery; a place where people can hang out and drink beer at a place that brews their own beer. The menu is actually pretty impressive and because of it, was difficult to narrow down the decision to just a single beer. Luckily this place does tasters, so if you're unsure about a beer, ask to try it! We ended up trying a few of their beers, including the signature Desert Rose, and all of them were really solid. I ultimately went with the Machine Gun Teddy and really enjoyed it, though their porter is on point too - and I normally don't like porters! Definitely check this place out if you're in the area. You won't be sorry!",5-star
Great little brewery! I had just got one beer while my husband tried 4 little ones. They also offer canned beers of your choice and growlers. What more can you ask for?,5-star
"Woohoo! This place just topped my list of breweries to visit when I want some cold, quality, craft beers when trying to beat that Arizona heat when visiting the Scottsdale area. I'm from San Diego, so not to sound snobbish but it's safe to say that I know good beer. Sometimes traveling to other states provides less than exemplary craft beer experiences when compared to my hometown. Such is not the case here at Goldwater. Goldwater Brewing simply makes great beer. Like, really great beer. Like, I miss the place already kind of great beer. I went through all their IPAs and Pale Ales because that's my preference and being from SD that's basically what you're required to drink, and I'm happy to say that Goldwater delivers on all of these styles. They might seem a little different or maybe slightly less hoppy, but they sure are good and extremely tasty brews. I'd dissect them one by one but I'm a little late getting to this review so the details are eluding me, but overall, I remember being very pleased with everything that I sampled. Aside from their Pales and IPAs, they have some other offerings that are pretty solid too. Their Desert Rose cactus ale is pretty unique, delicious, light, and refreshing. It's a little on the sweeter side but still easily drinkable, especially on those warmer days. What I was really impressed with though was their Scotch Ale. I really don't drink a lot of Scotch Ales but when they area really good, I remember them. Goldwater's Scotch is one of the best Scotch Ales that I have had. I'm an IPA guy but for some reason their Scotch was a major standout and I'd gladly grab a pint of it on my next visit. I don't know why but I was really impressed with it. Seriously give it a try. Aside from making great brews, Goldwater has and extremely comfortable atmosphere with great service. This place is a great environment to relax and indulge in some excellent craft beer. It's clean, it has a simple yet very rustic charm to it that just makes you feel comfortable the moment you walk in. The guy running working the counter slinging the beers was totally cool too and it just overall made for a really great experience for any craft beer enthusiast. If you don't like this place I simply don't have enough words to describe what is wrong with you. Anyway, I was only in Scottsdale for a short time so I really had to do my research and choose one brewery that I could visit. I chose Goldwater. I feel that I definitely chose wisely. This this is going to be the premier destination when it comes to craft breweries to visit when I'm in Scottsdale. The overall rating is pretty much accurate, although I give it five stars for offering so many different styles and doing each pretty well. Yeah, this place place is just that good. I really hope I find an excuse to be back in the area in the near future because I'd be happy to visit again...and again..and again. Seriously, folks, it's that good.",5-star
"Great brew pub. Very friendly staff and guests. Austin now know as ""Awesome"" was a great beer tender. We will be back for more.",5-star
"Fantastic service, atmosphere and selection of beer! I can't get enough and especially love the rooftop deck! Trying Goldwater beer is a must while in Scottsdale! Plus their beer selection in ""to go"" cans/bottles and merchandise have made great gifts for my friends and family! *Support Local Business*",5-star
Really great beer selection. Continuously evolving. Real beers. Not following IPA trends (although he has some IPA which i'm sure are wonderful). Beer lovers unite and help make this place a Scottsdale success story.,5-star
"An amazing local brewery! I've visited their tasting room a handful of times and enjoy both the beer and the vibe. It's a classy joint with a casual feel. Their master brewer, Chad, has a deft touch and his brews show it. It was also neat to spend a few minutes talking to the guy who crafted the drink I was consuming. Bought two growlers to keep me satiated until my next visit. Two thumbs up.",5-star
"Great spot, great beer and a really nice guy - what a great combination. Very tasty Desert Rose features organic AZ cactus (so much better than that Utah cactus). Chad's namesake McLellan is a great brew. The Black Gold porter and Brutus stout were standouts. Four of us sampled just about everything on the board on a very pleasant Friday afternoon. Once the door was opened and the spring breeze came in, Goldwater Brewing showed itself to its best. Loved it, will return.",5-star
"Love this place !!! Best beer in the valley, especially for a new brewery. I love their staple beers, and they always seem to have something new. Owners seem nice as well. Support small business",5-star
"Great Place for a drink! This little bar on the southside of Old Town is a must hit spot if you are craving some great tasting beers! Their interior is another one of those rustic farm-industrial themes, but it works well with what they have going on. The greatest part of this brewery is that they can seal up a tall can to-go! Never seen that before, but I'll be taking advantage on my next visit!",5-star
"Very pleasantly surprised by this small brewery. I stumbled onto their tap room after checking out Sip Coffee & Beer House next door. I typically enjoy dark beers, and the two that I tried here were both excellent: Black Gold porter and Brutus imperial stout. Both robust and flavorful. The true prize of the night was their Desert Rose cactus ale. My friend is not much of a beer fan, and it's difficult to find one he really enjoys. When the bartender poured his glass of Desert Rose, he said, ""WOW! Look at the color of that beer!"" ... followed by, ""That's delicious!"" The color is a vibrant ruby red -- really unique and beautiful. I also found it quite tasty. Goldwater can be a little pricey. They offer 32 oz. cans to take home, so I bought a can each of Desert Rose and Brutus... for a total of $48!! Yikes. Plus each pint costs around $7. Add the tip and you have a pretty hefty bill. I didn't mind this time, since I enjoy supporting a promising local brewery... but next time I visit, I think I'll avoid the take-home cans. Overall: 4.5 stars, bumped up to 5 since I had a very positive experience. Their beer is a treat to your eyes and your taste buds. Great service and a nice clean tap room (did I mention they even offer free popcorn?). A little expensive, but well worth it.",5-star
Pleasantly surprised by how many beers I liked from Goldwater! My boyfriend and I split a flight of everything except the porter and added on their newest (yet to be named) IPA. Every beer had a nice distinct flavor and the samples were quite large! The space is plenty for a small group and they have popcorn available for free. There is no food and no intention of selling food (asked the bartender) so come with a full belly or order from a restaurant nearby. Parking is kinda bad so I suggest parking at Walgreens and walking over. Definitely give this place a try!,5-star
I'd recommend trying the smaller glass if you're not sure what's good. There's also a popcorn maker and I heard was a guitarist occasionally on the weekend. There's also 32oz cans that are for sale that can be ordered for take-out.,4-star
"Not only is the beer delicious, but the bartenders are amazing! Definitely my go to place in scottsdale. Great place to hang out with friends and enjoy a cold one!",5-star
"I love it here. Tons of options, and great microbrews (if that's your thing.) Favorites include the cheese curds, grilled fish tacos, and sweet potato fries (they come with some kind of mustard that is amazing). I've always had friendly, prompt service.",5-star
"Fantastic all around. Food outstanding, service mostly great. Love the reservations option. Lots of variety of really good food!",5-star
"Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. Nothing to write home about, but the beer is good and the food is decent. All around a decent brew pub with reliably good food. Verona is small, choices are few, so having a reliable place like this is nice.",4-star
Mediocre ordered a medium rare ribeye got medium at best steak. This place takes No pride in delivering great food. Last time will not return,2-star
"I really want to like this place since I live in the neighborhood and can easily walk. I've been coming here since it opened and only had decent food once. Bar apps and drinks are great (if you're sitting at the bar), but beyond that the price/quality/service are way out of alignment. Currently sitting here for breakfast on Ironman morning. Breakfast buffet just opened, so you think it would be great, right? (BTW- it's not busy at the moment.) Eggs- clearly powdered eggs that weren't mixed well and are gritty. GRITTY eggs! Cold hash browns. Not mildly warm- straight up cold. Crappy biscuits and gravy. The only good thing on the buffet is the cut up fresh fruit and dried granola.",1-star
"Iv only been here a couple times. Don't get me wrong when I say they have great dessert but the meals not so much. My family seemed to have decent food but for some reason mine is never up to standards. My burger seemed to have been sitting awhile and the bread for soggy to touch. Had nachos and they came to me cold. I sent those back and all it tasted like was they microwaved them.. Didn't taste good at all. Not sure I'll be returned for the food but I do like the dessert. Great place to just get a drink and something sweet. Other than that, I'll start getting my meals other places.",2-star
"As we were finishing our business dinner my colleague said well we are 2 for 2 for dinner, this was great. Our clients recommended that we meet for dinner at Gray's as it was casual and close to our hotel. Gray's is indeed casual, but fine for date, family, or couple of drinks at the bar night. Their menu states that they local source a lot of their ingredients. And the statement that they have fresh fish available caught my eye. We ordered some local brews and their heart attack appetizer, the fried brats, and cheese, with the bacon jalapeno sauce. Yea it was worth it, spend an extra 20 minutes on the treadmill or take the extra Zuma class if you feel guilty. Our entrees included fish and chips, salmon, and their rib eye steak. All were AOK. Everyone who ordered the garlic mashed potatoes said they were excellent. Lastly service was spot on and friendly.",4-star
"This place was awesome. Fun, gorgeous atmosphere with live music on a Friday night. Prices are reasonable and food is delicious, cooked to perfection. Will be stopping by the next time we come through the area again.",5-star
"If I could give this place no stars I would! I came here with two of my friends. I ordered a chicken Cesar salad (requested dressing on the side), when my salad came the dressing was on the salad so I sent it back. When I got the salad back they had the dressing in the side this time, however I pulled out about a handful of ROTTEN lettuce!!!! I told our server, and he was making all kinds of excuses instead of taking my salad and getting me one that wasn't all rotten, so I asked him to have the manager come over. When the manager (Shaun) came over he didn't even introduce himself to us. He asked me ""what's the problem"" at which point I pointed at a pile of rotten lettuce right next to my plate. He picked it up with his hands and said my salad would be comped (not sorry about that, and not can I replace this for you?!). My friend who ordered a burger pulled out rotten lettuce from her burger and also handed it to him. He said ""I don't know why this is rotten I just opened the bag myself"". Well Shaun, if you opened the bag and saw rotten lettuce maybe you shouldn't have served it your customers! On top of that saw him ""wash his hands"" by coming up to the sink and turning the water on for 3 seconds. He didn't use soap and I'm pretty sure 3 seconds is not enough time to wash anything off! What makes me angry is the fact that he handled my food!!!!! If he is the manager at this place he needs to be fired because he is not doing a good job at all! I will not return and I hope that people read my review. I didn't come there for a free meal I came there for dinner! I also want to say that our server didn't know anything. I had to tell him several times to go and find out things like what's in their home brewed beers, or to go get the manager because the rotten lettuce was in my plate (otherwise he wouldn't have gone), or go get the drinks we ordered the way we ordered them (and don't give me excuses on how your bartenders aren't listening to what you're telling them, that's between you guys!) You chose to be in customer service to serve your customers, which you are not doing! Shame on you.",1-star
"We used Gray's Tide House as our wedding caterer. We could not be more pleased with how things went and how amazing the food was. The staff were super professional, excused tables quickly, replenished food quickly, cleared plates, etc. And the food was amazing (and hot!). We had pulled pork, beef brisket, loaded mashed potatoes, glazed carrots, and green beans. We have received countless comments from our guests on how wonderful the food was, including many saying it is the best food they have ever had at a wedding, hands down (I agree)! Seriously do not have one piece of negative feedback regarding the service they provided and would recommend them over and over again for any event that needs catering. They made the food portion of our wedding seamless and we are super thankful about that!",5-star
"THE BEST DEEP FRIED CHEESE CURDS YOU WILL EVER HAVE. If you've ever had deep fried cheese curds, you know that they can be heavy and greasy. To a certain extent you expect that. These are not that in the most refreshing way. First off, their cheese curds are clearly high quality and fresh. If you are from Wisconsin you know that fresh cheese curds are squeaky and moist (and you can tell that regardless of if they are cold or fried). Older cheese curds are dense and overly chewy. The beer batter really allows the cheese to take center stage. It is light and airy and flavorful. You truly taste the cheese in a deep fried treat that doesn't make you feel like you have a brick in your stomach afterwards. Their beer selection is solid and will appeal to all tastes. A great variety of pints on tap.",5-star
"We came here on reccomendation of a co-worker and because we had a coupon. The dinner started off badly because we didn't find out until we were seated that the daily special (2.50 taps) was only in the club bar. There were no signs showing that and our coupon said otherwise. Annoying, but we could handle it. Our server was prompt but very rude to the server she was training. We also got the vibe she was talking about us as she walked away or while watching our table, it was pretty uncomfortable. The food was ok, but not great. Had we had a better experience maybe we would have come back for something else, but I'd rather get a burger somewhere where the service is better.",2-star
Not a good experience. Enjoyed the pop rock rim and sitting outside. Ordered cheese curds to start. They were the worst I've ever had. Something was off about the batter and their cheese was not good. It wasn't at all melted (not melted on my mini burgers either). Our table also ordered a salad with tuna cooked rare. But it came out extremely well done. Somehow despite the hoard of signs requesting you wait to be seated a large group seized the table next to us by stepping through the gate at then complaining the tables were not clean (they had yet to be bussed from the previous diners) they then dragged more tables as they became available over to their camp making a huge scene and none of the staff said anything to them. Bad food served and bad manners accepted. I'll pass.,1-star
"Yeah, this place has officially hit rock bottom. A friend invited me to dinner, so I thought, hmm why not? I will try this place again. So first, our server, Shawn, was nice. Not very attentive but he seemed busy. We ordered the cheese curds and fried pickles. The pickles were some of the best I had had. The cheese curds were average. I then ordered the beef medallions. It came with a salad. The salad before the meal was the high point. The medallions should have been cooked medium. I could not see how they were cooked because they were covered in cold congealed gravy. The meat was rubbery and overcooked. The gravy looks like it had been microwaves over and over several times. It was globby. Is that a word? Because I can not think of another word. My mashed potatoes were cold. And in no way tasty or ""loaded"" as described. I never send food back but I did this time. The GM Andrea brought it back to me. It was OBVIOUSLY just microwaved. She did nothing to say she was sorry that my food was cold. It was obviously prepared and sat under the lights for awhile. I didn't finish it, I barely ate anything but the steamed vegetables and I was charged in full for my meal. It was awful. Andrea was so quick to leave that I did not get to tell her the beer I ordered was flat. The whole meal was gross.",1-star
"Gray's Tied House is what you could call Verona's version of The Great Dane, just not quite as good. The beer selection and cocktails definitely meet expectations and the food selection is extensive. The only issue with having such a wide menu is that it's hard to do everything well and as a result, the food is just average. I always have a good time at Gray's but always wish the food was better; maybe stick with burgers if you make your way out here.",3-star
"Gray's has become a family favorite! We found it when looking for a place to throw a bridal shower for family travel form different corners of the state. I checked it out with my family before we booked to make sure we liked the food. Eating there as a family we all found things we liked, especially the kids and the funnel fries. They are like funnel cakes, only in the size of French fries...so good. It passed the test. Setting up the shower was easy and the day of everyone was really impressed. The room had a great set up and the food was a hit. My husband and the groom really enjoyed it, seeing as it was a Saturday during a Badger game and they hung out at the bar. Apparently there was a great drink deal during the game that they both enjoyed:) The service has always been good. Definitely a place we recommend and will go back to.",4-star
"The food is terrible. Nachos are not difficult to make and when they are horribly made that's when you know the cooks cannot even work a microwave. Our server, Angel, was also very very inpatient and did not checkup on our table until we were still eating our entrees to bring us the bill. The seating in the dining area is also atrociously set and the booths are uncomfortable. I would personally recommend going anywhere else for lunch.",1-star
"I have eaten lunch at Gray's on numerous occasions and each time I have completely enjoyed the experience. I travel about 20 weeks a year and therefore eat out my fair share. It is refreshing to eat at a local business that has food that doesn't taste like every other chain food location in the country. Granted my selection when I stop at Gray's is limited but that is only because it is so damn good every time. When I stop I always have the Red Ale Ruben, Pub Chips and a Busted Knuckle Irish Ale. Hands down this sandwich is the best Rubin I have had anywhere in the country. Thick moist slab of corned beef with just the right amount of sour kraut and dressing. Then finished off with a nice slice of melted Swiss cheese and dressing on fresh bread grilled to a crispy crust. Great stuff. The beer is flavorful, consistent and a perfect match to the sandwich. By golly I think I'll have another.",5-star
"Totally ups and downs with this place. After a few year hiatus we went back and were pleasantly surprised, so went back 6-8 times. They seem to be on a ""down"" with recent menu changes. Food is OK. Drinks are good when orders are accurate. Patio is great when it's nice out. Indoor searing feels a bit like a loud warehouse unless you're in a booth near the doors to the kitchen.",2-star
"Omg. I can't express my pleasant surprise enough. Dash those preconceived notions of small town restaurants! Great job! Service: Excellent. We went twice. Both times excellent service by 2 waiters. I wish I remembered their names. Both had glasses. Anyway they were extra helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. Kudos guys! Food: Excellent! Again, I was prepared for mediocre bar food. Whatever you do, don't get the jalapeño cheese curds or you might get addicted like me. And the pizza was awesome. Great crust, great ingredients. Our margherita pizza had some sort of sun dried tomato spread in the middle which was a tasty extra. We totally loved it. My husband had a shrimp dish which I forget now but he loved it too. Nice big plentiful shrimp. The mushroom bake could do without the cheese and have more garlic, but was still very good. Lastly, homemade root beer! You can totally pig out on all the great food. And then pay for it in the gym later....:)",5-star
"Food is only average. Atmosphere very suburban mall-ish. If you usually eat at chain restaurants, you will probably be satisfied. If you have higher standards, don't bother unless circumstances (proximity, the preferences of your dining companions, etc) dictate that this is your only choice.",2-star

"I've been to Gary's Tied House a few times now - 4 I think, maybe 5. I really like this place. Now I haven't sat at the bar for a game, or gone out on the patio for drinks. My experience has been mainly coming here for dining only. Each time I was here I think I've tried something different. I've been happy every time. The prices are a touch high, but the portions are good and the quality too - and those are just as if not more important. When I was there last Sunday, I tried the Beef Brisket Grinder sandwich with chips. Beef Brisket with Scrambled eggs and chips and cheese sauce on a French Roll. Sounded too good to pass up. It really was quite awesome. My wife had the Pacific Rim Salad. She liked it a lot, although it was a bit spicy - but she knew that from the menu description. I can't recall the other menu items I've tried before, besides knowing that I've tried a burger. All have been quite well prepared and above your average pub food. Compliments have been unusual including this odd sauce that comes with their chips - super yummy but i have no idea what it is. A few times we have come on a Friday or a weekend, and its been a bit busy. But they are doing things right so I guess that to be expected. Not sure why I'm not giving them 5 stars - I guess I've only had a few of their beers and haven't tried the patio or anything. We'll give a few more tries and see if they can earn the fifth one. : )",4-star
"My favorite thing here, ok I lied. 2 favorite things: 1: They bring you giant drinks out on the patio. Staff is usually friendly, remember me and make excellent Vodka Presses. Ask for extra lemon! 2. I love the Ahi Tuna salad. The cucumber ""spaghetti"" with wasabi dressing is delicious. I order it every time. If you don't want a vodka drink and Japanese salad there are other choices. I've had a variety of other salads, burgers, sandwiches, etc. I think their cuisine has improved over the years. The outside patio has a big pond with a fountain. It's nice. Perfect for large groups, tons of space, 2 separate areas that can be rented out for private meetings or parties. Own parking lot. 14 minutes from downtown or 5 minutes from EPIC.",4-star
"I've been here at least 10 times. Mainly because of the convenience of going someplace with a decent atmosphere close to home. There's not much to choose from in Verona! When they first opened (2007?) it was OK, but not great. Then it got really bad - horrible service, bad food, etc. But, we gave it another try last year and the food was great - a noticeable and positive difference in the kitchen, the service was prompt, and overall we had a really nice meal. Now (2012) we go here on a regular basis and always have a good meal and good service. Atmosphere is a little hit or miss. Sometimes it feels like a family restaurant, sometimes it feels like a ""date night"" restaurant, and sometimes it feels like a sports bar. My only true negative is the hostess staff. Not a huge deal but they generally seem confused and give off the vibe that seating you is interrupting them from doing something more important.",4-star
"Gray's has a great atmosphere---we love the deck and the live acoustic music on Thursday evenings during the summer! The beers are pretty good (I love their Rock Hard Red...which isn't really a beer but it's a must-try if you're there)! The menu is diverse and generally tasty and I've never had a bad experience there. I'm docking a point because I would love to see Gray's switch up how they offer live music! They seem to have some great acts but it seems like the band or performer is always stuck in the corner (when performing indoors). For as much live music as they have---and for how large the facility is---it seems crazy to me that a more distinctive area wasn't designed for such occasions. Anytime we've gone there for live music we've either been unable to see or had to sit in the dining area (which doesn't have a view and the sound is lost). Anyways, no general complaints---if you're in the area it's a great place to check out and enjoy a few pints at!",4-star
"My husband and I were here last night and we thought our mushroom burger and taco pizza were both tepid and mediocre-tasting. We waited 30 minutes for this food and the place wasn't even busy at the time we ordered it, which was 5 pm. The great beer and friendly bartenders saved the night, though. On two other occasions, we had the pulled pork sandwich and the buffalo chicken wrap. Both were not good. We also both watched members of the Electric Blue band bully Brandon Beebe into ending his set early so they could set up their eleven tons of unnecessary equipment. We stayed for one Electric Blue song and didn't care to hear more. Honestly, the place is good for a beer and to watch sports on the big screens but that's about it. The facility is nice but I'm really surprised that the food continues to be bad.",2-star
"I recently scheduled two private parties here and both were huge successes. The first one was a small intimate get together to celebrate my daughter's college graduation and the staff was tremendous. They rocked it and made my daughter's day. The second one was a company party and from the moment I walked in when I saw one of my favorite bartender's (Heidi) hand stuffing my bleu cheese stuffed olives for my martinis, I knew it was going to be another home run. The food was fantastic and the service was out of this world. It's all good...",5-star
I live in walking distance but I still skip it due to the poor service. They have plenty of staff but they are unsupervised and not very attentive. I had two visits in a row where I was seated and forgotten. I usually have to walk to the bar to get service. The food is fine if you can get the staff to serve it. One final note they do not take discover if that is your card of choice.,2-star
"The service at this place is so brutal. I don't get how anyone can stand eating here. We have tried it 3 times now, and they have officially struck out. Will never be back. It blows my mind that people tolerate this kind of service when there are so MANY better places in the Madison area.",1-star
"Tasty tacos and would love to eat it more often but this place is NEVER open on time!!!! You show up at 5pm and it's closed (even though sign on door clearly says open at 5)., you show up at 7pm on a Friday and it's closed. You try to tweet them and nothing. Really annoying. I'm done trying to guess when they're actually open.",2-star
"I've been wanting to try this place since I first heard it open shop, and I was not disappointed at all!! The tacos were absolutely delicious. My friends and I each got a sampler or one of each selection so we were all able to taste each selection. My favourites are the pulled pork and the tofu. But since we each got 3/4 by the time we got to the last ones, the tacos were getting too soft or oily and so it was an absolute mess to eat. The tacos were falling apart even before the first bite. But aside from that, everything was amazing! I would definitely go back and recommend it others!",4-star
"Nom nom nom. We were a bit hesitant when we walked in and there was only one other couple in there. The only guy working the floor seemed a bit aloof, but with a six item menu, it didn't matter. We started off with the dumplings which were pretty much pot-stickers. Not worth the $6 for six, but decent enough and we were starving. Then came the tacos. Oh thank god, came the tacos. I used my girlfriend as an excuse to order two of each of the four choices; it made me wish I had more girlfriends to launder my gluttonous shame through. Unlike some other Korean tacos I've had, the beef wasn't from the sole of an old rain boot, the chicken was moist and spicy, and the pulled pork made sweet delicious love with my mouth. I wasn't too hyped for the tofu tacos, but eff me they were glorious. Thanks JangBang for making me look for excuses to hike over and give my money to you. You thoroughly deserve it. **Love the music.",4-star
"I love Korean Food. I love tacos. I hated this. The bulgogi beef was bland, served cold and didn't have any of the same flavours found in the city's better Korean restaurants. The pulled pork was watery, overly tasting of the PBR it's so proudly marinated in, and congealed when served. As Tacos, the tortillas were stale, the toppings wilted and they'd been clearly slopped together with no eye to the combinations of flavours, and within 2 minutes were inedible due to the rivers of sauce and broken, mealy tortillas. Even though I'd be happy if it was just bad food, it physically upset my stomach to the point of thinking I'd been served spoiled food. Coupled with the fact that the prices dont compare to the better Taco OR Korean spots in the city, it's not a place I could recommend to anyone. One star is grudgingly given for the Dumplings, which were actually pretty decent. Avoid this at all costs. They need to go back to the drawing board and produce good korean food AND good tacos before they can mate them.",1-star
"Countless times I have walked past this place, but today was different. Today I decided to look at the menu. It turns out there isn't one posted outside, so I popped inside. The menu only has four items (it really is a bar, after all) and I opted for the tofu taco, which is exactly what I was hoping to find. Korean restaurants and hipster bars alike are somewhat of a challenge for vegetarians and I was pleased to learn that there are both tofu tacos and kimchi. There are also pork, beef, and chicken tacos and non-vegetarian dumplings. This review is specifically for the tofu tacos. They are fucking awesome. One taco rings up at $3 and tax ($3.39) but you can get three tacos for $8 and tax. My first taco was so amazing that I ordered a second one and made a mental note to eat as many tofu tacos as possible in the future. They're small, served in corn tortillas and smeared with incredible guacamole, topped with fried tofu cubes (yum!), carrots and cabbage, cherry tomatoes, cilantro, sesame seeds?, and served with a slice of lime. I am most definitely a guacamole aficionado and can say that JangBang's guac rules. It rules so much that I actually thought that I had to Yelp about it. Oh man. Be aware that it will probably spill out of your tacos and onto your fingers, which will lead to you sexily licking off any trace of your meal and will probably one of the most pleasurable moments of your evening. All of that said, the guys that run this place are really cute (Really! It's true.) and I liked the decor. There were several musical acts performing (it seemed to be a lineup of male singer-songwriters) and the ones I heard were actually pretty good, encouraging me to stick around and enjoy that second taco. I noticed all of the drinks were served in Mason jars but I missed the memo about any sort of deal. It (sadly) wasn't that busy when I was there, but I would definitely go back, especially because Korean tacos, while a growing trend/fad around North America, are rare in Toronto. And delicious. I hope this place sticks around because it's a nice getaway from Sneaky Dee's/Ossington/the overflow and occasional suits at No One Writes to the Colonel. Good luck, gentlemen!",4-star
"I went to this place a few months ago when it had just opened. It definitely seemed like a work in progress, but given the high traffic location I was under the impression some good things might develop, even though the name is quite daft. Went back the other night and not much has changed -- lots of exposed wiring, random metal things sticking out of the wall, dodgy sound system and an overall ""we're renovating"" vibe. There's a lot of potential with the space but it looks like there's no plans to dress things up a little. Even the bar looks like a temporary set-up with Pabst Blue Ribbon taps taking up the majority of space. PBR also appears to be the only draft available. Still, the beer is cheap: $5-something for a PBR served in a mason jar. Mind you if you don't like PBR (which is not a very good beer) then you might be out of luck. Pitchers are $13-something which doesn't really seem that cheap to me given the low-quality selection. I think Jang Bang has potential down the road, but I was a little disheartened to see that very little has been done to improve on the space since I last checked it out months ago. The corner of College and Bathurst is a damn zoo on weekends so take advantage! As of now its makeshift appearance doesn't make me want to drink there, let alone eat.",3-star
"We had other plans on College street when my trusty Yelp app clued me in on an intriguing and hard-to-pass-up check in offer at JangBang: free PBR in a Mason jar. Being part hipster (and a huge Mason afficionado) I insisted we chart a new course for Bangsville. The place is certainly more a bar than restaurant. Sparse seating, taps you can see from the street, posters on the wall, and sexy mood lighting. But still we were hungry. JangBang's conceit is an interesting fusion of Korean cooking and tacos. (Ta-Kos?) The menu had four options: chicken and beef tacos, Korean pizza and something called Mandu; dumplings available steamed or pan fried. The options are mad affordable, so me and my DC split our orders of chicken and beef tacos (two each for $6) down the middle. Service was great, and they even pre-split the order on our plates to save us time. A prescient move since these tacos need to be eaten with haste and care. They were served on soft corn tortillas which is not something I've experienced before. Unlike flour tortillas they were a little delicate (i.e., very delicate) so it wasn't long before I was scooping bits of meat into my mouth from my plate. (N.B. No forks. It was messy.) The chicken was tender and had a nice kick, but I much preferred the beef tacos. It was like bulgogi Mexican style. It wasn't too filling but it's definitely a decent snack. With a complimentary PBR, you can't go wrong. We left before the nightlife kicked in, though the place had a cool vibe. This is a place to grab some snacks before getting your crunk on to the backdrop of a DJ or live band. They feature both regularly. Cool spot! Obligatory Title Pun: This spot is BANGIN'. Menu Readability: One page, four items, sans-serif, white-on-black. Need to mention: A mason jar = a pint. They are $5.25 regularly. What this place teaches me about myself: I'm the duke of Bangsville; and I don't mean on Yelp. Hiyo!",4-star
"We had found a coupon on restaurants.com for this restaurant. Highly HIGHLY disappointed. To start, the staff gave us a hard time about trying to use a coupon. If you don't know how to run the coupons or don't want to deal, then don't advertise them online? The wait staff was probably the rudest I've ever seen. They make you feel extremely uncomfortable and make you feel that everything you ask for is a bother. Extremely difficult and unpleasant experience. All aside from the fact that the food well, sucked. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.",1-star
A good place to go if you're in the mood for just a traditional breakfast. Prices are reasonable. Pretty outdated environment,4-star
"I live in the area of Jodi B's. I would really like to give this place a better star rating, but I just can't. I have given this restaurant several attempts to earn a better rating, it is just not there. The service is lacking on so many levels. Friendliness and prompt service, not there. The food is lacking in flavor or taste. I have had the dinner specials and the burgers, not impressed. The wait time is horrible. The food price is reasonable, but the quality of food is not. I believe is it family own and run. They do as little as possible. They have locals that come in every day, for company or just for lack of any place else to go, not saying that is a bad thing, but the voice level is so that everyone in the restaurant can hear the conversation. This has been experienced on more than one occasion. I have not been there during brunch on a Sunday. I have only been there during the dinner hour on a week day. I was not impressed and will not return. They do have coupons available and no reservation is required.",2-star
"I try to like this place. It is local to me. Food is a bit better than ok, calling it OK. Service is not that good. They just do what they have to, to get food to you. The past 3 times I have eaten there, I have been by myself, so obviously check to be smaller than table for four. Same waitress each time. Very little eye contact, no dialogue whatsoever, even from others who work there and walk by you. Tab was $9.50, gave her a $20, and she comes back with 2 5's and change. Did she really think I would leave her a $5 tip. I did have a $2 bill, which I left. It has been like eating at a fast food joint, only with better food. Very Impersonal. If I could, I would leave 2 1/2 stars.",3-star

"Found out from a mutual friend that this establishment had changed ownership since the last time we were here (see my previous review). The ownership may have changed and the interior does look much nicer with updates and an added bar area but nothing else has improved. Barbie still makes the tiny toast, the so called ""home fries"" are Ore Ida frozen potato cubes ( we call them bag & spoon fries) and the overall portion sizes and quality is not good at all. We had high hopes for the new ownership but it looks likes Forest Hills will still be without a decent place for breakfast.",1-star
I love Jodi B's. My usual Sunday morning place to go to when I don't want to make breakfast. The food takes homemade and the waitresses are amazing. I always recommend this place to anyone who lives around the area.,5-star

"I had breakfast here last week. Not impressed in the least. I pulled into the shopping center and it was so dark I was unsure if the restaurant was even open! I walked in and there were approximately three tables with patrons there. I ordered a regular breakfast (meat, potatoes, eggs, and toast). I have to agree with an additional poster that this is home of the worlds smallest toast. I had sausage, which I am pretty confident that it was brown and serve from the microwave. Eggs were ok, potatoes were small and greasy. Place just had a dirty feel. I will not be running back here anytime soon. There has to be better. I ate here when it was the Plaza and that was better. Plenty of room for improvement.",2-star
"Great place for breakfast and lunch, a little less so for supper. I've been here many times and the morning and midday service and food is consistently excellent. The evenings can be spotty though, with meal quality uneven as well as the wait staff. It's not the Ritz, so if you have easy to reasonable expectations chances are you'll be satisfied.",4-star
"If you are in the area and you need a place to dive in for some pancakes in the morning or a quick burger and don't feel like backtracking all the way to Drew's, Jodi B's isn't bad. Not great. The food is overpriced for diner fare and this storefront restaurant does not look like it has been updated since the 1970s. The music is invariably boring--musak renditions of old standards. The service is warm and friendly and they will bend over backward to make you happy with your food.",3-star
"Nope. Another dump, same as the others in the area. This place has seen its heyday come and gone, whomever owns the place is just administering CPR and hanging on. Prices are in line with the aforementioned dumps and their food is bar food - nothing more than that. Place is old and dank, atmosphere is artificial unless you're a regular (every bar has them). There's nothing special here, nothing whatsoever that would entice me back for another visit. You could take a pic of the bar and it would pass as any other dive dumps in the area. It pains me to rate this place truthfully, as I spent many years residing in the area and frequented this establishment on many occasions in the past. But, this place has not aged well, no matter how many coats of paint you use to hide that fact. Oh well, it's just a bar, nothing that is absolutely necessary to sustain a good life - there's plenty of much better pubs to enjoy. Peace.",1-star
"Nothing here but the usual Dive Bar feel. They have a grill and the food is the usual fare, nothing more - sometimes it's good and sometimes not. This place has the usual tired setup for the dive bar feel, sometimes you get a good feel in here and sometimes you do not. In the past I did visit this establishment on many occasions and the visits dwindled down as the place just settled into the aforementioned dive bar feel. Their prices seem to be in line with the other bars in the area, which fluctuate from time to time. The restrooms are small as hell and semi-clean, better than some of the others around I must say. Overall, I visit here on rare occasions any more, just nothing here to bring me in.",2-star

Has a covered, enclosed, smoking area out back that you can drink in.",5-star
"I work here, and I play here, I'm always comfortable and have made a lot of friends here that I now call family. Our new owners are fun and attentive and are working to make this bar the best it can be. I want to point out that they are very caring people and I'm not really sure where the previous commenter got the idea that they are anything but. I am a very happy employee, spoiled even, and I will continue to work and play in this bar as long as I'm able!

"Lived in the neighborhood about a year before we knew this place even existed. In a strip mall in the corner of a Sprouts center. Came with 4 other people for a few hours during happy hour on a late Friday afternoon. At the time they only had a bartender, no waitress. Bartender acknowledged us soon as we walked in. Found a long high top table across from the bar. All but one ordered bottled beer. Beers were cold and rum and coke strong. Ordered wings and onion rings to share. Wings were really really good. Rings appeared to be hand battered, fried fresh. Food was standard bar food and we would order it again. Early evening a waitress came on board. Restrooms clean. I'd say this is a middle aged persons bar. For someone just looking for a few drinks. Nothing fancy. No drama. Pleasant staff. Pretty good food. We will keep Kirk's in our rotation if we are looking to just get out or meet friends for a few.",4-star
"This is by far the worst bar I have ever stepped foot into. I was there on a Saturday night and some fat bartender was beyond biligerant and yelling at an older gentleman in the bar. She was rude and disrespectful, I could not believe that she even worked in that place considering how drunk you could tell she was. I will never step foot in this place again and will make sure to NEVER reccomend it to anyone.",1-star

"Decided to stop in on a Friday afternoon with the hubs and use our restaurant.com coupon. The area it is seemed a bit sketchy, but we took our chances and were not disappointed. Pam the bartender was a delight and gave us a tour of the bar and told us some stories of the place. We then ordered he ""specialty"" for dinner and it was excellent, patty melts are my favorite and this ranked pretty high. The place has pool tables and dart boards galore, so if you are into that, this may be your go to place. Great juke box, service, food, and the place was super clean! We will go back!",4-star
"Kirks Korner is a family oriented bar where everyone knows your name. Go on down and grab a bite to eat, watch a sports game, shoot some darts, play pool or even sing karaoke. Great atmosphere and wonderful pepole. You just might even meet the owners Bob and Judy Kirk. See ya there.",5-star

"Weird location for Kirk's Korner: stripmall bar in-between the Sprouts and payday loan store. Killer setup with 3 50"" HDTVs on the main wall when you first walk in. Anyone sitting there has primo real estate for college or pro football multitasking. 1.75 draft beers...maybe a bit more. I did not explore the other side but they had more TVs there. Smoking patio (of sorts) in the back. There was a random cross-section of young and old people that all seemed to get along well. I recommend if you're in the area.",5-star
"Okay seriously.... my ultimate favorite place for Mexican food! On this visit I strayed away from my usual ""La Piñata"" chimi. Wanting to try something new, I got the steak fajitas.

"My husband and I love La Piñata! We were even there twice this week. Whether you are sitting at the bar or at a table, you will receive great service! When we sat outside, our server was energetic and attentive. The drinks and food came out quickly and were delicious. When we sat at the bar, the chips and salsa were served promptly and so were our drinks. If you like margaritas, I highly recommend the margarita made fresh and upgrade the tequila to Hornitos. Oh my gosh, so good! For food, we ordered a kids meal which was a great size and price. I ordered the Salad Carbon with grilled chicken. That jalapeño ranch is delightful too! My husband ordered the Tacos Del Mar and was very satisfied. Also, one of my favorite things about La Piñata is their decor. The little piñata that serves as their mascot is just the cutest. Also, no matter where you sit you will be comfortable. Check this place out, it's pretty awesome!",5-star
"Not that the food was bad but the service... my husband and I have been going there since this location opened. Last time we went our experiences wasn't that great. So we hadn't been back in 6 months till today. Our server was the bartender and we sat in the corner table. 1st he got my husbands order wrong... whatever, towards the end of the meal I wanted another beer, he never came over, in fact I watched as he talks to a guy sitting at the bar ignoring us and the table next to us, so I went up and ordered my beer, he was quick to bring it out at which time we asked for to go boxes and our check... 15 minutes go by and he's still talking to the same damn guy sitting at the bar... by now I'm pissed. So I start to stand up to go talk to the owner, he sees me, runs over with the boxes, and again I have to ask for the check... I left pissed off and angry ... in my adult life I have never left such a bad tip for service, but ignoring your customers doesn't earn u a big tip. Here's a hit, if u don't have time to wait tables DONT, leave it up to the servers... WE WONT GO BACK",1-star

We come here often and have never been disappointed in the quality of the food, generous portions, and friendly service of the staff. 100% of the time we take part of our meal home so the value equates closer to two meals for the price of one. My husband always orders the same thing, and has for years, the Carne Macacha dinner! I i'm more adventurous and have tried just about everything on the menu and it's all been delicious. I've never been disappointed in one single bite. Guacamole is outstanding! I had the chicken tortilla soup on our last visit and it what is hearty and delicious! It is topped with fresh avocado and tortilla strips and cheese and is even better than mine and that's saying a lot! If you want nonsense real deal Mexican food, this is the place!",5-star
"So I was coming from Portland on a weekend trip and wanted some good Mexican food. Not nouveau, authentic, fancy, Mexican. Just honest to goodness tasty Mexican food. And a margarita or three. I did a lot of research and talked to many friends and finally settled on this place. Mostly it was the pictures of the beans and rice. I like my beans pinto and mashed. And I like rice that is not in the shape of an overturned bowl, meant to look fancy. So we get there on a Friday night around 7 and I'm expecting a wait because the parking lot if filled. We enter through the back and immediately the fresh smell of peppers hits us and I know we've made the right choice. We were immediately seated at a nice table by the bar and it was our good fortune to have Gabby as our server. She was very sweet and had a can do attitude! She recommended several dishes and we decided to start with the Mary Lou Christmas tree. It's basically a fat quesadilla served with beef and red sauce on one side and pork and green sauce on the other. It was phenomenal and a ton of food! Seriously we would have been full from that, but my wife and I love enchiladas so I ordered the red/cheese with beans and rice. She ordered the chicken ala carte. Again, very, very good. Great salsa and chips too. We wound up taking at least half the food home and had for lunch the next day. The margaritas were just ok, not fantastic but the service was A plus! If you're looking for good, down home, tasty Mexican with great and friendly service with huge portions at a very reasonable cost. this is the place. There, aren't you glad I did your research for you?",5-star
"The new location is very nice but a lot smaller than the old location. The open dining room makes it very noisy at times. Chips were hot and fresh, salsa and hot sauce was tasty. The food came out in a timely manner served hot. The green chili chimichanga was good. Meat was nice and tender. Just wish they put more of it in the chimichanga. I felt I was getting a lot of tortilla per bite. Matthew was our server and he was awesome! Very attentive and checked on us regularly without hovering. Thank you Matthew for making our dinner experience even better.",4-star

Peter, one of the owners, is a wonderfully great person! ALWAYS have some of the best conversations with him! Super personable and well liked individual, and also one of the MAIN reasons I continue to visit La Piñata over and over again! Definitely would recommend La Piñata to a friend, and will continue to come here again and again!",5-star
Good family friendly restaurant in central phoenix. This new location is very clean and feels somehow modern. The food is mostly good but Americanized a little. Tacos and burritos with lots of cheese (maybe too much) and the spicy level is quite low so the chips and salsas are kind of weak. Overall a good choice for Mexican food.,4-star
"I absolutely adore coming to La Pinata. I moved to the central part of Phoenix about six months ago from the west side of town, and at the recommendation of a good friend, came here. It's become one of my favorite places for Mexican food. The service is always great and attentive (I often choose to sit at the bar), and the food is to die for. Do yourself a favor and get the Mary Lou with red chile. Delicious!",5-star
"Oh, La Piñata. How I loved your old location and how I loathe the new one. Suddenly, a charming old school Mexican food with amazing food, margaritas, and servers turns into a loud, chaotic cafeteria experience with a parking lot far too small to accommodate the droves of people who (thankfully) didn't know about the other location. While the food is still the best Mexican in the city and the margaritas on point, coming here has become more of an annoyance than a joy depending on the day. I'm sure you've gotten a lot of new business, and I'm happy for you for that... but this location stinks!! It has become another loud, trendy Phoenix restaurant restaurant with no unique attributes.",3-star
"Warning: the food and service is still wonderful. HOWEVER, without telling us, they added an 18% tip to our check. We only had 6 people in our party. Plus the tip was AFTER taxes.

Pretty annoying. Other than that they do have big portions of food and some stuff is good some stuff is okay. I wouldn't recommend the steak taquitos as they are very bland and over cooked. The tio fundido chimichanga is really good though. This place is okay...",2-star

"So far we have tried La Piñata twice, and have really enjoyed it! Cool design inside. The food has been excellent, one of our new favorite Mexican restaurants. So far we've tried the fajitas, the Chile relleno, the chimichanga and another chicken dish, but can't quite remember the name. All the dishes taste authentic without being the generic Mexican food you sometimes find in AZ.",5-star
"I just tried to make a reservation for 15 people in March at 11 am on a Tuesday and was informed by a very rude female. She said ""we do not take reservations"" and I asked if they would for 15 people and she said "" I told you we don't take reservations"" and hung up on me. Is that the way you run a business? Very poor customer service and I have no intentions of ever coming there or recommending it to my friends.",1-star

"I love the new location! They made the move from their old location on 19th Avenue and Osborn to the old Mary Coyle building on 7th Avenue and Missouri recently. Glad they moved, the old one had great food but the location was getting a little sketchy. They did a complete renovation of the inside. Nice modern Mexican theme. Same great food here at the new one. Excellent service. It was packed when I was here. Great chips and salsa to start out. I had the green chili quesadilla and albondigas soup for my entree. Both really good. The green chili was hot! My friends had beef chimichangas and said they were excellent. I am looking forward to going back here. Check out the new location! Enjoy!",5-star
"The NEW La Piñata is a major disappointment !! This is a great place if you like your food served tepid. The WAS one of our favorite haunts ( 200+ visits over a number of years at the old location). Since their move in October 2015, things have deteriorated. The service is now mediocre and slow. The noise level is profoundly louder. The food is not served hot. The lunch special menu variety is greatly reduced. Our LAST visit at the new location was today (our third attempt for a satisfactory experience at the new location): We asked our waiter to make sure our order was served hot. The food was barely warm. We opted to take our food home to heat it. When we asked for a container to take salsa home - the waiter informed us that the charge would be 75 cents. We were insulted, especially since we had unsuccessfully asked our waiter three times for our first salsa refill. In spite of all of this the restaurant seems busier - since the move. I am truly happy for the owners - but WE will not be returning. Three strikes and you're out. There are too many better alternatives. For example: Jordan's Mexican Food on 7th Street has vastly superior service, good food, and is pleasantly quiet. It is only about 5 minutes away from the new (not improved) La Piñata.",2-star
"I guess no place can get it 100%. It is crowded and we've always had to wait. No big deal for the right place. We like the patio though the fake grass wall is weird. Like many others I suppose, we have a favorite place for one dish and another place for another dish. We've only been there twice, each time we were a party of four so we tried several different dishes. Their cheese crisp is standard (not as good as Los Compadres if you like a really crispy tortilla which we do), tacos were just okay, the enchiladas were a bit better, the salsa was ordinary, beans seemed canned and the tamales were downright boring. The best dishes we had were the Pollo Azteca and the Pork Carnitas. We'll probably go back occassionally for those since they are walking distance from our house but when we want really good Mexican food, this is not our place.",3-star
"This place was great! I wasn't sure what to expect based on such mixed reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised. Great food, attentive and friendly servers and a nice atmosphere. We went for an early dinner on a Friday with our kids and sat on the patio and everyone was SO nice. Best Mexican food we've had in a while and in a great place! The only negative I can think of is the parking, which can definitely get tight as the restaurant gets more crowded. Can't wait to go back!",5-star
"My uncle worked at la piñata while he was going to ASU..about 20 years ago. So I've been coming here for years. Not my go to Mexican place usually..but with their new location it could be. It's super cute! They needed the upgrade. I sat at the bar - ordered a michilada. The bartender made up their own. It was pretty good. The menu design is a headache. Stuff all over - confusing. I didn't see a enchilada, taco, tostada, bean and rice combo. So I went with the relleno, taco and tostada. Chips and salsa was delivered promptly. The chips - a little stale the salsa -- well it wasn't ketchup thankfully. But s jalapeño wasn't in the top 8 ingredients. The food was okay. For all the white people in the area.. This place will be off the cha..ughh it will be busy and do well. I'll stick to tacos atoyac. I need some spice to my life.",4-star
viva la piñata!! I suppose I have to thank the Spanish conquering of the Aztec empire which paved the way for this Gem of a restaurant. These brave restauranteurs have started a revolution in my mouth! Go here and you won't be disappointed! Service: 10 Food: 10 Ambiance: 10,5-star
"Went on opening weekend so they were out of a few things. Still trying to figure out the kitchen. Forgiven. However what we did order was fantastic and the owners, waitress, and overall ambience was 5 star! Fun hip place, clean, modern- made us feel like family there.",4-star
Not the best food I have ever had. Let's just say the food was pretty bad but the waiters were decent the bowling was the stupidest thing the arcade was the best however! If your looking for quality food don't go here. But the prizes are to much because they are thirsty for that money. In conclusion I give this place a 9/30.,2-star
"It started out really fun. Bowling, Games, Movies, Comedy club, Food... Then something happened. Rumor has it that the management changed hands. From there it went down hill. Still lots to do, but the service is just so so, and the food is not even as good as Eat n Park. The comedy club is not fun or funny. I joined the Blue membership level a year ago, and just canceled because we really didn't want to go there any more. If I want to go bowling, I can go to my local AMF lanes, or others, as they all have food and drink now, at much better prices and service. If I want comedy, there are MUCH better places to go in PGH. Sorry Latitude 360, its just not there anymore...",2-star
"The service is HORRIBLE. My boyfriend and I came here today for a ""fun"" day out. We got to the venue, and it wasn't crowded at all on a Saturday afternoon. The bowling desk advised there would be a 45 minute wait to bowl. So we went to the restaurant are down stairs to grab a bite before bowling. We were seated in an almost empty dining room. It took a lot of time for the one waitress that was working to come and serve us (not her fault though). I asked her for a drink menu, and she advised they were out of a lot of the alcohol on the menu. So I just ordered a cranberry and well vodka. We ordered our food, and the food was actually good and it arrived hot. Although some other worker brought it to us, and seemed confused as to whom the food was for (with only one other party that was seated). My boyfriend had to flag him down. I also ordered a glass of water from the waitress twice, and never received it. By the end of the meal the buzzer for bowling was ringing. Perfect timing actually (tried staying positive). The bowling attendant downstairs was very nice, got us our shoes, and told us our lane number (15 - which was upstairs). We get upstairs, and there were dirty plates with fries, chicken bones, empty Corona bottles, half used cups of ranch, lime wedges, etc., all over the table (see picture). I buzzed for someone to come and clean the table, but no one came until we had 10 minutes left to bowl... Bottom line- just don't do it. This place was super cool 2 or 3 years ago. It's clearly gone down hill at a fast rate.",1-star
"I just read a comment from yesterday that I echoes my thoughts as well. It's as if this place is going out of business at any moment. I went through no less than 6 different items on the menu before finding one that they had. Things were filthy through-out, many, many things were broken. Leaving preparing to dispute the charges for membership since they aren't providing the facility or services that they're advertising. Details below... We had come to have dinner and bowl. We didn't make a lane reservation (which I accept fully) and came ready to wait. The problem is that we were told 40 minutes when walking in. After dinner I asked where we were in line and was told that we were next. We tried to go to the arcade to spend some time (and money) . When walking into the ""arcade"" we found that over half of the machines were either off or the card scanners didn't work. Nearly all of the prize machines were empty and the ticket redemption room was closed and had nearly no stock anyway (I may have seen a tumbleweed blow by). We went back to check on bowling since it had been 30 more minutes and was told it would be another 20 or 30 minutes. I looked at the lanes on the ground floor and there were 6 open. I was told that they were all broken... For those keeping tally, that's about half the arcade games and 6 of the bowling lanes inoperable and terrible availability on the menu. I should also add that we went through 3 high-chairs before we found one that wasn't too broken to use (but still broken, mind you) The cleanliness... Garbage under our booth, glassware in the women's bathrooms along with toilet paper all over the floor in both the men's and women's bathrooms. The arcade display case had empty beer bottles in it along with half finished cups and pitchers ready for less supervised kids to get into. Bottom line: Staff: Literally ALL of the staff we came in contact with seemed to be miserable. The people staffing the bowing counter were condescending with poor communication skills and didn't seem to understand what the word 'next' means. For a customer-facing position, I can't stress enough how poor the communication skills were. During dinner, the waitress and hostess seemed to just want to get rid of us ASAP. The concierge at the front was nice though. Facility: Feels like half of everything is broken in the arcade and bowling lanes. Pretty sad level of cleanliness. Look at the pictures in other posts, a week later and exactly the same. Food: Very poor availability of menu items. Had to settle on pizza and the four cheese and pepperoni and cheese came out with near Vincent's level grease on the pizza, which is good and expected at VINCENT'S, not ideal for kiddy consumption. Bright spot: Fried pickles. Edit: So after reading reviews it's obvious that this place took a nosedive around October 2015, which is a shame because the facility itself has serious potential. It appears this this precipitous decline is directly tied to their corporate leadership and the site not having any budget to keep the facility and amenities up. Hopefully they get their $%!# straight for sake of the jobs involved. Pittsburgh is the last of 4 sites remaining open.",1-star
AVOID! JUST DON'T EVEN TRY TO COME HERE. It seems as if the place is going out of business. We had to pick 3-4 different entrees before we landed on something they had. They were out of most foods and didn't notify us until 45-60 minutes after we ordered when they delivered the rest of the food to our party that they didn't have the tacos my wife ordered. Asked to speak to a manager. She walked away while I was still speaking. Had to seek out a second manager who admitted that corporate didn't provide them with the funds to run the place properly and understood our dissatisfaction. Only positive thing I can say is that the second manager was professional and comped (sp?) our meal. Feel bad for the employees because this place will be closed if they don't turn it around. But you should avoid this place. Go anywhere else. Anywhere. Even McD's.,1-star
"We were here for a friend's birthday party. We had a large group but our waitress took forever. It was almost an hour after we sat down that she was able to take our order. Most of our drink orders were wrong. When we went to the bowling lane we had reserved there was trash EVERYWHERE, even though we had the lane at 8:30 and didn't make it over until 9. We had to pile it up and put it by the trash can in the corner. They were out of many sizes of bowling shoes and we didn't even try to order drinks because it was clear no one would help us. I hope to never come back here again.",1-star

We were early, and waited 30 min to get drinks....it was 50/min ( after the movie started) until we placed our order...our waitress brought half of our food....then brought another plate....the brought me 3 different plates....none what I ordered. When I finally got my burger it felt like it was sitting under a warming plate the entire time I was waiting for it. It was terrible. And the check was wrong... My wife went back twice to try and fix it.....after the movie all of the card charging kiosks were out of order...games out of order...we left. Last time we will go there... Period.

"Upon arriving as a rookie to this spot, Latitude 360 is quite impressive. This joint is huge! Two levels of bowling, full arcade, large stage for live bands & comedy shows, two full bars and a large dining area. I attended a work holiday party on a Thursday & to my delight, Thursdays are ladies night! They had vendors inside the front door selling jewelry, clothing & kitchen products. Ladies bowl free (if you don't reserve a lane in advance) and shoe rentals are half off. The bar also has drink and food specials during Happy Hour. I was meeting 5 other people and after we got a drink at the bar, we were able to snag a lane upstairs. Sounds like all the ingredients for a great night, right? It had potential, I'll give it that. Unfortunately, the following events occurred and I couldn't justify a rating above 2 stars... 1) After we settled into our lane and plugged our names into the computer, we were booted. Management told us that there was a miscommunication and our lane was previously reserved for a party. They gave us one game for free but with two paid for, a third made the night too late & a free drink or appetizer would have been a better option. 2) We moved downstairs into our new lane and started our game. There were only XS bowling balls at our lane. Only one out of our six could fit her fingers in it. We spoke with the manager and he said they don't have a separate stash. Whatever they have on the floor is the only selection so we had to ask our neighbors to use their bowling balls. On top of that, the pin sweeper broke every few bowls and we had to reset the turn. The pin sweeper also spit out a pin or two onto the middle of the lane & we had to wait for them to spin to the gutter before bowling our turn. 3) We had to request food and drink service to our lane since no one checked in. When our food arrived, we weren't given silverware, napkins or extra plates. The drinks were served quickly but weak on the quality. The mixed drinks tasted watered down. Due to those events, we didn't have time to play another game. I had a lot of fun with my group but overall, I was disappointed with my first experience at Latitude. I'll probably go back for a special event but I won't place them on the top of my list for a night out with friends.",2-star
Great place for a Christmas party gathering. But food was horrible. Buffet was not kept full and food was cold. Also it was overlooked and chewy. and undercooked. Appetizers only have cheese no crackers. Veggies were fresh. Also don't leave your drink alone for a second. It will disappear. I was gone just 30 seconds to grab my handbag from a table and my glass was scooped up.,1-star
"Saturday night after dinner my fiancé and I went here for some music, drinks and to bowl! The bowling lanes were full until 11, so we went upstairs to have a few drinks until then. The Band Bon Journey was playing, which seemed a little old for the crowd, none the less live music is always great! We waited for 10 mins at the bar before being noticed by the bartender, when we ordered a captain and Coke and glass of wine she rolled her eyes like a glass of wine is SO inconvenient. By round 2 I ordered some tequila shots, no lime or salt given. By this we should have quit and left.. But before we went to bowl I order 2 cherry bombs.. Biggest mistake yet! She tells me they don't have cherry vodka and asks if grape is okay, I politely say yes and then the bartender, Leigh was on her name tag, says ""sorry I poured peach, I hope that's okay"" then pours WARM monster on top. I almost gagged! If I am paying $50 for 2 rounds of shots and drinks I think it should be served properly! We were so upset we didn't bowl and left! I will NEVER RETURN!",1-star

Tonight we decided to bring our daughter and have a sit down dinner and then play arcade games. The service was bad from the moment we walked in the door and we asked to be seated. Everyone that worked there looked so confused. They sat us at a dirty table and never came to clean it. I'm pretty sure they only had one waitress and it took over 10 minutes to get our drinks. When we finally got our food, it was average bar food. Pretty pricey for the mediocre food. In the end, we felt like no one cared they were supposed to be working and the food wasn't good.

"Been a member since October, love the place! We live 40 minutes away and it's worth the drive and the $25 membership fee for all you get! I see people post that it's too far away to join, well, it's worth it for us! Each month we get 2 free comedy tickets (and I'm constantly winning extra ones) so the hubby and I are guaranteed one date night a month. 1 hour of free bowling which we use after comedy show to ""bowl away our buzz"" and drive responsibly. Free movies Monday-Thursday for up to 6 people so our family of 4 can always be found in the back row at the 6:00 Monday kids movie. Free kid's meal and $5 game card with every adult entree! Our bill is around $26 and with a generous tip, we usually spend $40 (I keep in mind all the free stuff I'm getting and tip the servers well since we're regulars-they take care of us; we take care of them!) Still, $40 for 4 dinners, 4 movies, and $10 in game cards is a crazy good deal! You got a question about this place, I can tell you; I practically live there!",5-star
"This place is huuuge like a mall- I came here with my neighbor, walking in- it had soo much entertainment. Definitely really cool- like a more developed dave and busters. Of course it was extremely clean, looked brand new. Stocked with a full arcade, movie theater, and bowling alley it is quite unique for a restaurant/bar. Cool feel. The menu was simply too large for me, I couldnt decide, luckily our waitress was quite patient. Ended up getting the shrimp poyboy and it wasn't my favorite honestly, but at the same time the food was decent. It just was not anything major. We didnt play any video games or watch any movie- so I am merely rating my experience of food. I would definitely return and try something different and play around for a couple hours. definitely has some potential.",3-star

"eh... Is really how I give my opinion on this place. It's just not set up right in my opinion. When you walk in you're immediately greeted with two places to eat. A café style restaurant or pub style. Both serve the same food so I don't really understand that one. Why not put a restaurant upstairs? I heard good things about the theater and stage though. Two large bowling lanes boggles my mind when you could use some of that space for a bigger arcade or club. The club upstairs is small and not organized properly, and the arcade downstairs is just boring. It's like some rich guy's game room with some games just thrown in there. All in all this place is ok for a large group but be prepared because this place gets packed. Food is ok beer is typical and staff is average.",2-star
"It's a really fun grown-up entertainment complex tucked into one of the many shopping plazas of Robinson Township, a la Dave and Busters. I've been here twice now, and the last time was for a private company holiday party. On both occasions I found the staff to be quite friendly and on top of things. Bowling here is pretty pricey, but you're paying for atmosphere and the equipment is nice and modern. They have live bands, a dance floor, more than one full bar, and a game area. I would say that the games are given pretty limited space compared to everything else, but that's probably because they make more money serving alcohol than letting people play driving games and skee ball. At any rate, it's a fun spot for a date night, night out with friends, and I've even seen families there for the food and games, so all in all, this is a pretty good, well-rounded place for entertainment.",4-star

I planned a last minute surprise birthday get together for my husband that needed to accommodate 30 people, and Latitude 40 was not only able to do that but they also typed up a special menu for us and allowed us to do separate checks. The food was fabulous! The room was quiet and private, and they gave each person a free movie pass! Ashley helped me coordinate everything and our server Kerri was very helpful!",5-star
"Latitude 40 is just like a Dave and Buster's. It's a bit expensive to bowl and play, but I'm okay with it. The novelty of paying skee-ball with a drink in hand is worth an extra buck or two.

"We did the cinegrille movie experience. Got mahi tacos and shrimp po' boy. The food was quite tasty, well seasoned. No clue how it looked at all, but the movie provided enough ambient light to eat.

Honestly I didn't mind the pacing, I was quite content watching the movie on the plenty large projector in the comfy very spacious bucket seats.

"Cigar Bar Review... 5 Stars for having the guts to have a nicely furnished Cigar Lounge. The chairs were very comfy, the hostess was quick & efficient, the prices were great for Robinson and the place filled up rather quickly after we arrived. The cigar selection is rather limited but I wouldn't expect this place to have a massive humidor when they don't know if this is going to take off or not (I carry my own supply). On price- the Kuba Kuba's that I normally smoke cost me about $8.50 each- here they're $12. This place's comfort is worth the mark-up. The tv's were all on The Final Four tournament but the hostess quickly turned on something else when a couple guys requested it. My only complaint was that the door to the lounge doesn't have one of those automatic closers so the smoke would 'waft' out into the hall/bathroom area if someone forgot to or didn't notice they had to close it manually (I try to be a considerate cigar smoker). If you're in the area and looking for a nice place to enjoy a quiet smoke, check this place out...",5-star

I personally had the chicken Caesar salad...hard to screw up right? For one thing, the tiny burnt chicken I got cost $4 extra, the dressing tasted terrible, but at least it covered the taste of the bad lettuce. The comedy act was ok...the opener was terrible, but the main act had us laughing semi consistently. I will never go back...not even if every bit if this expensive terrible night was free.",1-star

"So much to do ... This a mixed review of the place. I will start with the fun factor :-). This place offers many things to many different people. Downstairs - There is a a restaurant, bar, and bowling. This reminds me of many of the bowling / clubs I have been to (Lucky Strikes, Tora (where there is bull riding), etc...). Upstairs - There is more bowling, a bar where there is live music, a movie theater with an incredibly large screen. Many things to do if you are in to it. I went to see Uncle Kracker play. They are still working out the kinks in my opinion. Uncle Kracker played and half the tv's in the bar were still tuned to ESPN and Fox News. They will quickly turned the tv's to the musician after a request was made. The fun factor rates high. The drink prices are more than what you would expect. Parking is terrible. There are signs asking you not to park in the shopping center lot. Food The food is not very good. I have had their version of big bang shrimp (shrimp with a tempura batter, deep fried), seared ahi tuna, and nachos. Shrimp and ahi tuna will only be ordered again after providing the wait staff special instructions (cook / sear). The nachos are really bad. Thin chips with movie quality cheese sauce (They are cheap). I will go back if I am with a group for drinks (decent beer selection) and live music. I will not dine there - they should remove the restaurant and put in another bar / feature live acoustic acts. Summary: Fun Events: Good / Fun. Prices: Pre-made Long Islands were $9 per... pretty expensive Beers run $5-7. Food: Bad. Order at your own risk. Service: Good until they get busy. The staff when I have been there have been overwhelmed or disorganized. Parking: Terrible Overall - I give it a below fair rating hoping they will improve.",2-star
"I created a Yelp account solely to write this review....... -Waited 25+ minutes for a waitress to take our order -Service was absolutely terrible--group of wait-staff stood around talking while we waited to order -Waitresses were rude and unprofessional/inexperienced--dropped glasses/trays/plates 3 different times causing a huge commotion -Food was overpriced and not good--cheese wasn't even melted on nachos -VERY loud, couldn't hold a conversation with people 3 feet in front of me at my table -Bartender had a bloody finger and continued to serve people with a napkin wrapped around her hand as a bandaid.

My Husband and I went on 11/16 for date-night (sans our 2 children), and it was awful: too much unused space; entirely too expensive ($46.00 for 1-hour of bowling after 5:00 pm on the weekends); too many children (curfew is 11:00 pm); typical bar; and the food menu was similar to that of an Applebee's. To top-it off, the place wasn't finished: the Theater wasn't open; there were roped-off corridors that weren't painted; the ""night-life"" area was closed, because the lighting wasn't done.

Walking in, the decor on the inside was very disappointing, we thought the place looked like a orange colored dinner.

I didn't really care as they seemed to have what we usually like. Well, they were out of two of the things we wanted... My falafels and my boyfreind's Kabob. How can a Mediterranean resto be out of those 2 items? We ended up ordering a fattoush salad, the falafels-less mezza plate and some sandwich for my boyfriend. The salad and sandwich was not impressive. The mezza plate had a very good tabbouli, the hummus was good but not the best in Las Vegas (as they claim) and I didn't care for the stuffed grape leaves and baba ganoush at all. The waiter was friendly, but overall the place was nothing special, had no ambiance, the menu options and food taste was pretty weak. I seriously doubt they will be in business very long.

"Happy Hour goes from 5pm-8pm. Half off appetizers, wine, beers, and well drinks. The selection of appetizers are limited to the six that appear on the menu. The rest of the items are reasonably priced, if those do not satisfy. None of those small bites are over $10 during HH. There is hummus, baba ganoush, crab falafels, hot wings, and two mixed plates that are good for sharing. The baba ganoush was delicious and came with 8 pieces of pita to wipe up the goodness. The wings were standard, coming in an order of six. The hot sauce is made with the garlic chili sauce used in Chinese cooking. Beers and wine seem to be the way to go for their HH. My mojito would not be considered a well drink even if it used stock rum, and came out to full price. To get half off, the drinks need to be the simple well alcohol+mixer. Otherwise it treads on the line of a signature drink or specialty drink. The mojito was good nonetheless. The service was mindful, with two different servers checking up on us often.",3-star
"No doubt, the worst full-service restaurant in Southern Nevada. You are far better off sitting in the bar than the restaurant. My wife and I visited the restaurant on a Friday night at 7 PM which is prime time for most restaurants, but a total fail for Laziza. With all the cars in the parking lot (one shared with several other restaurants), I thought it might be crowded inside. There only maybe ten tables in the dining room and only two were occupied. There were a fair amount of people in the bar. I ordered a diet Coke. Guess, what they were out of diet Coke. So then I order an iced tea. Ok, so then the waitress comes back and says they are out of iced tea, but delivers another diet Coke. This one isn't right either (fountain not working correctly), so still not diet Coke. So I asked for water, which I woudn't see for another 30-45 minutes, long after my entrée arrived. The menu is supposed to be Middle Eastern, but contains Philly Cheese steak, Asian (Chinese) Chicken Salad, Fried Chicken and Lasagna. I'm no expert on Greek/middle eastern food, so I decided to try the samplers - the Mezza ((labneh, hummus, falafel, baba ghanouj, tabbouli, grape leaves and pita) and the Laziza Sampler (like middle eastern empanadas). They were ok to me, but over priced for what you get. Service was slow (especially considering there were only two other occupied tables in the dining room), if you could find a server at all. To add to the ambiance, there was an open mic night going on in the bar, and since the dining room opens into the bar, there was no sound barrier and was very loud, lots of bass and feedback. It was an overall unpleasant experience. They never have to worry about seeing me again, but then again I don't expect them to be open much longer.",1-star
"I came here late on a Sunday to see a DJ spinning that night. We had the ""Mezza"", which is like a big sampler. The food was all right. The service that night was frustrating. We asked questions about the menu (recommendations, etc.), she couldn't answer. The ditz seemed like she wanted to drop the subject and hide behind the bar. When she brought out the sampler and named the dishes (hummus, tabbouleh, baba ganoush, etc.), my friend asked what are they made of (ex. chickpea spread, parsley salad, eggplant mash). She seemed caught off guard. It didn't matter since our group of friends weren't picky eaters. She rarily checked our table (we were the ONLY ones eating in the lounge; rest were smoking hookah or downing beers) and seemed to be having a bad night...",2-star
"I've been here a couple of times and like it, but don't love it. I think it's a cool place to hang out in the evenings; they have a DJ and have different events going on in the evening depending on the day. (Last time we went, it was open mic night; some people are really good!) I'm not a hookah person, so that may have some bearing on my experience. I think they do reverse happy hour but haven't stuck around long enough to find out. Last time, I had the Maxeki Margarita, some tequila concoction off their list. It was ok, but tasted a bit like alka seltzer (thus bringing back horrible memories of Lolita's in Town Square). I've also had the Falafel Pocket; the patties are good but the wrap was a little dry/hard. The hummus is delicious and definitely worth trying. All in all, it's a cool place to hang out, but the food isn't super great (or at least the times I've been there). Also, once the night event start, it's impossible to have a conversation with anyone at your table, even if you're sitting in the restaurant section. If you're there to eat with someone else and/or a group, it's probably best to go earlier in the day.",3-star
"All of my co-workers one day showed up for working noticeably hungover - the cause? Laziza. The next week, I decided to join them in the debauchery of Makeout Mondays. Laziza is the epitomizes the all that a hookah lounge should be: dimly lit, DJ pumping out good music in the corner, a dance floor (which that night, was for vanity rather than for function), and a well-stocked bar with drink specials throughout the night. Our hookah had a mix of various tropical fruits (I believe mango and pineapple) and mint - boy was it smooth. I'm usually not a fan of hookah, but every time that hose came my way, I went to town. As for the drinks, so many stipulations to the drink specials. My coworker was disappointed he couldn't partake in two dollar vodka drinks since they were for the ladies - a stipulation he'd like to dispute! Also, in order to get all of these deals on drinks, you have to order at the bar - a detail overlooked by our waitress when we asked her and subsequently ordered from her. However, I'll overlook the fine details, for this is the only place where the bartenders and waitresses know what a White Boy is. Having never heard of it, my coworker ordered me one - a Blue Moon, mixed with some orange juice and a shot of Amaretto. One of my favorite drinks definitely - I've ordered it elsewhere, but the proportions are never perfected as they are at Laziza. As the night progressed, my crazy coworker ordered a round of Lemon Drop shots. What a perfect way to end the night - that is, after some dancing and a few embarrassing photos afterwards. I now get the appeal of Laziza. Drink specials, dancing, and dim lighting leads to uninhibited actions, which in the case of my coworkers is both an excellent and dangerous thing. We left around 3 or 4, only to return to work at 6 - all of us inflicted with a terrible hangover and the desire to fall back asleep once we were off. Thank you Laziza!",4-star
"We went to Laziza after work for happy hour and it was disappointing, we ordered most of the appetizers, some drinks and a hookah. Of all the appetizers the hummus was the best but everything else was just bland. The service was ok when we actually saw our waiter. For a Hookah lounge I was expecting something a little more intimate and comfortable. I won't be going back to this place again.",2-star
"Good time on the weekend, enjoyed live band (but way too loud). No idea how the food is but it looked good and there were a lot of people eating. A cool lounge atmosphere.",4-star
This is a great place in the Henderson/Green Valley area if you are looking for a hookah lounge with a nice Mediterranean menu.,4-star
"My friends and I decided to drop in on a Friday night whim. We'd never been here before, but upon entering it looked very promising. The interior was a lot larger than we expected, and we were escorted to the smoking section of the building. The service was excellent, however apparently Friday night is open mic night, making it impossible to have a conversation without yelling over the music. As for the important part, the hookah, it was subpar at best. Having been smoking for years, it was really disappointing after all the awesome reviews. Trying to get service to fix the harshness of the shisha was even harder with the loud music. I think I'll stick to making my own bowls to smoke at home.",1-star
"Based on the reviews, my bf and i decided to check this place out. We had a pretty bad experience. I won't deny the happy hour selections are pretty good, but the drinks were awful. The service is what turned me off the most. Having a waitress come take our orders took 10mins, then another 10mins passed, and then another, finally we asked another waitress where our drinks were and she apologized and went to put it in. So then after that, it took about another 15mins for our appetizers to come out. They did apologize to us, saying their system was down, and then to us it looked like they didn't have enough staff. I tried to keep this in mind, but i still couldn't help but be bitter. We got so annoyed, we didn't even want to get a Hookah. We weren't the only people unhappy that day. The tables around us were also complaining. Might of been just a bad day, but it was enough to turn me off. Maybe in a few months i might give it another chance...if it is still around.",1-star
"This place is GREAT for happy hour. We got here at 5pm when they were barely opening their doors so we sat at the bar. The bartender apologized for them being unprepared as the manager got there late... not a great indication on how the place is managed. They had half price apps, house wines, beers, well drinks, and their bottled beers were $3. We ordered the Mezza appetizer (labneh, hummus, falafel, baba ghanouj, Tabbouli & pita) The menu says it serves 4 and they are not kidding. LOTS of food! A couple of beers and glasses of wine and our bill was only $22. Unbelievable! We will be back to check the place out late night.",4-star
"Nice bartender who was pleasant and attentive. The hummus was not the best in Vegas as advertised, as it was rather plain. The calamari was good. The price was also very reasonable.",4-star
"I've had Laziza on my mind all week since the Sunday night teaser... and convinced some of my girls to head out with me to share the love on a Saturday night. We decided on the liquid diet (and who wouldn't when ladies drink $2 vodka well drinks all night!), but broke it to sample the baba ganoush, which was addictive. The DJ was on it... like a rocket... I mean, old school (""PYT"" -- sigh, MJ -- you were a genius -- RIP); new school; and techno/electronic, with some Middle-Eastern thrown in for good measure. I figured this place couldn't get any better -- but then the belly dancer came out. Little-miss dropped it like it's hot... and then some. WOW!",5-star
"Not too shabby, not sure if worth more stars... 1. Location - Great location in strip mall, easy parking and easy to get to. 2. Ambiance - really nice and relaxing. We went early, so no music which allowed us talk and converse in peace. 3. Service - Not bad, yet this place could have improvement in this area as it is adequate, and not terrific. 4. Price - Very Reasonable. 5. Food - The hummos had a very nice texture. the babaghanoush was succulant with its wonderful smoke / grilled flavor. All the entrees were okay, and not great and I would have expected more great flavors in all other foods. I ordered the dish with extra steamed vegetables and I got instead an order of frozen type vegetables that was fried or with oil instead of steamed. Check this place out. Remember that Hookah is actually a not healthy for you!",3-star
"I came after dinner with a few Yelpers to sit and have drinks. I originally wanted the Baklava-tini but then our server said they didn't have martini glasses and it would be a wait so I got a mojito ($10) instead. It was alright, but a bit heavy on the citrus element. Our server was friendly though. The table shared guava mango hookah ($15). Even though I lost my taste for hookah smoking a long time ago, I knew this wasn't premium tobacco and when I saw them lift up to replace to coals that there was quite syrupy stuff in there so it's probably a type of mu'assel, possibly even not tobacco based but herbal based but I would have to open the foil to really tell. It had a throat feel that I think I've grown to not find enjoyable. However, I don't deny the flavor tasted good. We went during Raggae night and there was a live band playing. It wasn't too loud even though we were right in front of the band. Lots of people were having fun and dancing so the vibe in there was good. I wouldn't say I would come to seek this place out, but if I'm around the other side of town and my friends want to smoke, I don't mind accompanying them.",3-star
A very fun hookah lounge. The servers are very friendly and they always check up on you if you need more drinks or if your hookah is up to par.,4-star
"After having a good kick back time at a Yelp CME with Misti and friends I broke off from the group and met up with some friends at Laziza. So I get there a little later than everyone else but they already had the table set and drinks ready to be poured. I walked in and the DJ was spinning hip hop. The music wasn't too loud and the transition from hip hop to house to other genre was well done and mixed. I didn't order any food this time but I've had them before. The hookah was just coming out and the workers kept the coal and ashes clean. Love this place late at night, hate the location, but worth the drive every time we go.",2-star
"I get it. It's a hookah lounge. That serves alcohol, which is pretty rare nowadays in Vegas. However I knew some friends who were throwing a party there and decided to go, mostly because they were boasting free alcohol for ladies for this private party. The place overall has nice decor when you walk in. But then it gets confusing as you head to the back where the bar is. There's an indoor ""patio"" and a huge room with nothing in it. A few booths and a few tables, but it seemed really open and under-furnished. The bartender ladies were super nice and greeted me immediately, which is refreshing since most women bartenders ignore other similarly-attractive women. The drinks (keep in mind they were free so I wasn't expecting amazingness) were really sugary and sweet. I ordered a few jolly ranchers for me and my group of friends and although it tasted good, it left that sweet/sour taste in your mouth. Plus after 10 of them, you start to feel a little sick from the sugar, and not buzzed enough. The music was some weird Reggae music. Not good reggae, just weird pop-trans-throw-in-some-reggae-music. The hookah was good, and they changed the coals often, which was nice. Overall my friends and I had a great, fun time. Should go back one time to try the restaurant.",3-star
"I was very excited to go to Laziza after reading the Yelp reviews, but I left sorely disappointed. The ambiance seemed very inviting at first, until I realized I couldn't even read the menu it was so dark. It didn't help that the DJ had a terrible affinity for the Black Eyed Peas (no less than five songs by them in the two hours we were there) and other top-40 junk and the bass was jacked up so high, it was literally shaking my chair and my friends and I had to yell to have any chance at hearing each other. I could have forgiven those shortcomings had the service and product been decent, but that's where Laziza really fell down. It took the waitress twenty minutes to get us our beers, and she didn't offer us water. We ordered the apple hookah and when we hadn't received it after forty five minutes, we approached the nearest waiter and asked what had happened. He responded that he would have to get the waitress. Twenty minutes later, she still hadn't shown up, so we had to track her down. She gave us a hurried excuse about forgetting it and eventually we got the hookah without enough mouthpieces for our group. It took us another twenty minutes to get her to come back, during which we noticed that the hookah tasted awful -- more like black licorice than apple. We pointed that out to the waitress, who assured us it was the correct flavor without bothering to double check. So we ordered another beer, which she forgot about, water, which she forgot about, and more mouthpieces, which she also forgot about. Meanwhile, we watched her spill a drink on a girl at the table next to us. Disaster. Given our horrible experience with the service, my group did not want to leave a tip. However, because we had six people, she automatically added an 18% tip to our tab and we were sure if we asked her to take it off, we would've had to wait another half hour, so we just bit the bullet and left. I will never return.",1-star
"Unfortunately I wasn't able to sample any of the larger portions of food that is here, but I was here one night during a college function and I have to say the atmosphere is very trendy and lively. As far as the little party appetizers went, I was a big fan of the hummus and pita bread served. Our function had a DJ so of course there was some mainstream music bumping, but besides that the ambience was dim and welcoming, a little cozy, and the hookahs featured were tasty. One of my drawbacks was that the bar was a little pricey, but then again it wasn't too bad given the atmosphere. Am definitely interested to come back to this place again for a 2nd and a more in-depth review!",4-star
"Music was great!! They had this Samoan band playing, they were GOOD. I thought the price was too high for just couple drinks and some hookah. Couple hours here for two would run you about $50 plus tax and tips. We did enjoy ourselves while we were here.",4-star
"Five stars from me are hard to come by, but I thought about it... And I thought about it, and I think Laziza truly does deserve a five-star. I don't smoke hookah, but I have been here a couple times to hang out with friends. It is a good location for me since I only live a couple miles away. The ambiance at Laziza is really cultural - a very nice place to hang out with friends. As other reviews said, they do have a live DJ. There is also a dancing area, but it is not crowded and packed like a club would be, so that is a plus for me. (For those of you who are shy about dancing and being seen, then it might not be something for you.) The DJ plays a mix of Arabic/Persian and American hip hop/R&B music. I personally think it is a nice mix. I also tried the filet mignon kabob, and it was delicious! The kabob also came with either a house salad or soup of the day. I tried the lentil soup, and that was also surprisingly good. The menu is not too extensive in the sense of Mediterranean-wise, but it is extensive enough for those who just want a burger and fries or shrimp scampi. Most importantly, the service is great! For all the times I have been there, the staff always seems so eager to help and to make sure we are okay. I will definitely recommend the next hang out with my friends to be held here. If you are in the area, definitely stop by and give it a try! You'll be surprise!",5-star
"Laziza is the place to be! Great food, the kabobs and hummus are amazing, and it's all very well priced. The atmosphere is very relaxing and a nice way to unwind after a long day. It's a pretty large restaurant/lounge so there's a lot of seating and plenty of room. The times I've gone I've participated in this awesome Lebanese dance and there's always good times to be had! I live all the way in summerlin but I still drive out to eastern and 215 to go here, it's definitely worth the drive! Go to laziza, you won't be disappointed!",5-star
"First of all, I would like to state that I did not eat here. I was interested in trying this place because of their claim of having a stuffed pizza. Being a Chicago native, I wanted to see if it stood up to a Chicago-style stuffed pizza. When I arrived, at 6:00 PM on a Saturday night, it was closed. There was a sign on the door stating they were having problems with the kitchen and that service should resume on June 30th. Today is September 13th!!! Seriously, a note on Frunchroom's website, Facebook page or Twitter saying ""hey, we are closed until further notice"" would have been nice. Instead, I spent 30 minutes walking in a cold downpour just to find out they were closed. A little common courtesy, as well as a little common sense, goes a long way.",1-star
"Please up date information, they are temporary closed until end of June. But this is mid of July now. It feels bad I went there with door closed.",1-star
"An overall disappointing experience. Unwashed oysters full of sand and shells and horribly shucked, sat with empty drink glasses for over 30 mins, manager with a bad attitude - drinking beer with the DJ while we sat and waited for service - and poorly trained staff. The restaurant was completely empty and this should have been a warning sign of what was to come. I doubt this place will survive until Christmas. I wouldn't recommend going here at all.",1-star
"Not knowing that they essentially shut down from 3-5, I walked in alone at 3:30 to grab a bite/drink and kill time waiting for a friend in the area. As no one was around, I found myself asking the owner (Moe) if they were in fact open. So easily could he have shooed me away, but instead he welcomed me in. I had the burger, fries and a beer. Simple but classic. The burger was juicy and the non-ordinary bun/sauce really paired well with the onions and portobello mushrooms. Filling without being too heavy. This is the first restaurant I have seen that really nailed the shoe-string fries. Recent changes to the menu have added a lot of mouth watering plates, and had I had a significant appetite there would have been too much to chose from. Excited to return for happy hour martinis and live music. Food is must try, and the great ownership / service are what keep people coming back.",5-star
"Forget the critics, this place is awesome. Great drinks, delicious food, wonderful atmosphere, and all on a strip of René-Lévesque that was in dire need of some new life. If I could recommend one thing off of the menu, it would be the thin crust satjou (probably got that wrong), eggplant and goat cheese pizza. It's freaking unbelievable, and at only $13 for a full pizza, it's a steal! Oh, and the staff are some of the nicest I've encountered in months. Despite -20 weather in late March, they were as friendly and helpful as you could have asked for. Definitely worth checking out!",4-star
Very cool and cozy place. It's great for big groups and venue space. I like the warm tones and 2 levels. Food and drinks were good. Nice concept and cocktails.,5-star
"I was there for a birthday party, and considering the size of the group the service was good. I find the food to be very commercial and please do not order the duck confit salad. It is a wilted grilled heart of romaine (in one piece) with a piece of duck on it and a little bit of this questionable white sauce. I was completely turned off and just ate the duck, which was OK but have had way better. This should not be served as a salad dish. Thankfully I ordered the french onion soup as an entree. It was comforting, very salty but acceptable. I will not be returning.",1-star
"This place had great interior design, but their cook should change profession immediately, I think food and service was the reason why the place immediately shut down!",2-star
"Steamies, wings and fries... Absolutely Amazing! Montreal poolroom is my standard and though different, the steamie was so delicious! A top sliced bun would put it over the moon. Fries and wings were both super fantastic (esp homemade ranch)! I've never written a review before but this was really worth it!",5-star
"We had the corn dog, po'boy and coney dog. I'm not impressed at all. The bun was a wonderbread-type of cheap hot dog bun that would get supper soggy. The toppings were all subpar. Heck even the dirty street dogs are better than this. Their fries were overly oily and soggy too. I have yet to find a good hot dog in Toronto.",2-star
Love this place. Best Pogo's and Mac and cheeses. My son loves it and so did I. Best music. All played on vinyl. Service was outstanding. Thanks Cassidy. Definitely be back.,5-star
Nice vibe. Bartender who was also the server was friendly. Menu looked interesting but didn't try it yet. Loved the record player as the main source of music!

"The food is amazing. Some of these hot dogs can be only described as delicious abominations. Like, if Frankenstein's monster were a really tasty meal, he'd be here. Had one bad time when no one bothered to show up to take my order. But all is forgiven with Dorrito battered meat.",4-star
"I order their cheese fries religiously. Seriously, I order them at least once a week. They are hands down the best I have EVER had. Great mozza too. And when you go in store they let you play your own vinyl. Love it there.",5-star
"I had the mac n cheese hotdog with coleslaw. I loved it! Perfect amount of mac n cheese on top. The coleslaw wasn't as creamy as I like it, but it seemed a bit more rustic than regular coleslaw which I guess is nice. I haven't had a hotdog in years and this really hit the spot.",4-star
"Was looking to buy lunch on a Sunday afternoon to reward myself for completing a project. As I was browsing through the options in Yelp, I noticed that Let's Be Frank had an offer for free fries with every check in, and who could not resist free food? So I went in to Let's Be Frank, and ordered a Mac n Cheese, Katsu dog and the free fries, obviously. There was only one server present, but the store wasn't busy at that time. She was really friendly and made me feel welcomed to the store. The food came in less than 10 minutes, which was quicker than what the server told me. Hence I can say that the service has been fantastic. Now to the food, the Katsu dog was first off heavenly. The sauces and spices on it, combined with the panko covering of the hot dog, makes the taste of a simple hot dog be heavenly. Comfort food got elevated to a different level. Next about the Mac and cheese, there was just a perfect amount of cheese on top of it and the bacon bits and spring onions added onto such a great flavour to the simple Mac and cheese dish. The fries were alright, but overall Let's Be Frank has this amazing ability to elevate comfort food to a higher palette, and that too at an affordable price. I would definitely recommend people to try out this place.",5-star
"I wasn't expecting much when we walked in, we just wanted some food, after waiting at another restaurant for an hour and half for our food (never got it). I'm glad we walked in though. The Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich! TRY IT. My boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich, which the enjoyed.",5-star
"I came here on a lark, because it is about as close to school as you can get. Who is ever in the mood for hot dogs, you might ask? I was skeptical too, but this place delivers the goods. They're not just hot dogs, but fancy hot dogs. The dogs themselves are delicious, and the toppings are varied and fantastic. The fried chicken is fantastic (heed their warning about how spicy it is) also. I very much like how you can get a variety of sizes without paying much of a penalty, which encourages you to try many different types of hot dogs for about the same price as one large one. And finally, the ambience here is great. They are always spinning super cool records.",5-star
"I wasn't overly excited when my roommate suggested Let's Be Frank for dinner. I wasn't in the mood for hot dogs (I actually wasn't in the mood for anything except beer). When I walked in I was pleasantly surprised. I thought this would be exactly like Fancy Franks (I'm not hating on them, I like them, I just wasn't in the mood for hot dogs). Let's Be Frank had hot dogs, fried chicken, chicken burgers, mac and cheese, and BEER on draught. They had booths which my roommates and I could all sit at. Our server was wonderful. We got a pitcher to split between us. I ordered the small mac and cheese (it's enough... trust me) for $5 and a regular hot and steamie which was $5.50. The bun to meat ratio was on fleek. The amount of sauces were also on fleek. I hate coleslaw but I didn't mind the coleslaw on my hot dog at all. The mac and cheese was delicious. It came with barbeque sauce and bacon. Standard extra sauce on anything just warms my heart. It was pretty darn good and the portion size was big, I wasn't able to finish it. Also!!! They let you pick the records here! They have tons, I didn't get to look through them but my roommate put on Arctic Monkeys and I was very happy with that. Way to go, Let's Be Frank! You've won me over, I can't wait to go here again!",5-star
"Some friends ate here a few weeks ago, and liked the food, so yesterday I went over to get an early dinner before heading on for an evening of boardgames on Yonge street. I wanted food that would stimulate my gaming edge and the dressed up hot dogs did the job pretty well :-) Pros: I instantly found my favorite spot inside which was this cozy area across from the television. As soon I plonked myself on the couch, I already felt at home and it was so relaxing to sit back and watch the games while waiting for my order. I picked the two that stood out from the menu: the 6 inch Pulled Pork Po Boy + a fried egg, and the 6 inch Katsu Dog with extra wasabi mayo. the Po Boy had a filling amount of pulled pork and coleslaw on it. The katsu dog had a good crunch on the coating and the best part of it was the mayo and you couldn't go wrong with adding more if to go with the taste of the panko coating. I'm glad that I took my time to eat both of them because I started to get full half-way through. Now that's a filling meal. I think the Po Boy alone with a side of fries would have been enough for a hungry person my size. I don't really listen to blues or bluegrass in my own time but the music that was on was so catchy that I often found myself tapping my feet to the rhythm :-) and also at some point someone put on some electro urban beats which was just as catchy. Con: The only con about the interior was the black washed wall on the one side. It gave one half of the inside this dingy atmosphere and switching places over to the couch area made the ambiance more comfortable. Other than that, I'm definitely a fan of the food here and there are still more delectable choices on the menu to try.",4-star
I had a great time at Let's be Frank. I had the katsu dog and the Mac daddy - both were awesome! The service was also very good! Will def be back.,5-star
"Food: Ordered sliders of katsu dog, korean bbq dog, and the tijuana danger dog. Out of the three, our favorite was the korean bbq dog. The katsu dog was great, but the tijuana danger dog was just ok. We also ordered the hot dog gravy poutine and the mac & cheese. Being a poutine addict, I had high hopes for the poutine when I saw picture of it on Yelp. They actually used cheese curds, which is a big plus vs other place in toronto that use shredded cheese. No complaints about the fries, but the gravy was a little odd - it's extremely buttery and thin without a lot of flavor. The Mac and Cheese on the other hand was AMAZING!!! Big portion for the price. So creamy and combines perfectly with the bbq sauce and bacon bits. The bacon bits were unique and had a really nice smokey flavor. Usually I'm apprehensive about ordering mac and cheese but so worth it. Service: The service started off great. The server greeted us promptly after arrival. However, once his shift ended and the next server took over, the restaurant got packed, and the service was non existent. The place was understaffed so I wouldn't blame it on the server. Price: The food is worth the price and towards the cheaper side of the spectrum. The mac and cheese, and poutine was huge for $5. Ambience: It feels more like a bar than a cozy joint. Loud music and dim lighting. Overall fun atmosphere for a night out. And I loved the GIANT HOT DOG DRAWING on the wall!!!! Parking: There were only a few parking spots on the street, we went earlier (around 7 p.m.), so it was easy to find a parking spot. But I'm sure there's a parking lot a few streets down by Kensington market.",4-star
"This is a REALLY hard one to rate. Cool laidback place, seems great to hangout (maybe too laidback?) Everything had just gone wrong with our order! We showed up on a day they had some special ""spaceballs club"" event. I've been to Nashville and I have tasted all the great temples of Hot Chicken there. I was beyond excited to find a place that had it here. We came in and asked for the owner to ask him about his recipe and which Hot Chicken place it most closely resembled and how the levels of heat compare to known places in Nashville. Disappointingly, he was not there, AND his staff member had no idea what we were talking about it. His only descriptive term was that ""it was really hot"". He's never been to Nashville. Excitement meter went from 10 to 8. We ordered a single piece of hot chicken to go to try. No one told us the kitchen was backed up. We checked at 35 min, they said it was coming out soon. Excitement meter down to 6. But, no one told us it would take OVER AN HOUR??? C'mon people I don't have an hour of my life to waste for this. If you had been straight up with me I could have gone grocery shopping, watched half a movie, or even eaten a WHOLE sit down meal in the neighbourhood before coming back. Excitement meter down to 5. I open the box, when I get back. Damn. It was the wrong order. Excitement meter down to ZERO. It was a hot chicken sandwich. (4stars for flavor) It was a very tasty sandwich, but not what I ordered. (Now it makes sense why it was so much more expensive than expected). But, really to fry 2 boneless chicken strips took you guys an hour??? I really still want to try the Hot Chicken I had come there for, but once bitten twice shy? No one likes being let down.",1-star
"I was going to give them 4 stars, but then the bartender played a Fleetwood Mac record! Amazing! We'll start with the best: hot dog sliders. We had the coney dog, super steamie, and Korean bbq dog. They were so damn delicious. Just getting hot dogs next time! The fries were good, but we also got the fried chicken sandwich. It was just okay and a bit dry overall. Service was great too. It wasn't busy at all for a Friday night, which was surprising. I'll definitely be back.",5-star
I've been to this place twice now and have yet to have a bad experience. The cheese fries are killer and you get a huge portion for just $5! I'd definitely recommend this restaurant-bar to anyone looking for a delicious bite or a craft brew.,5-star
"Great choice of draft beer! Let's be frank is a bar that acts like a bar. Their food (starring hot dogs) are creative, surprising, and amazing. The best feature is the existence of different sizes which range from finger food to full meal. Great veggie options. Place looks simple yet not plain. You get this punk/funky clandestine concert venue from the 80s with a special touch of friendliness. Crayolas are available.",5-star
I wanted a late nite snack so i browsed through yelp and this place came up .Best decision i ever made.finally and super chill place with good music and awsome food.i had the mac and cheese dog and my friend had the Tijuana . Both were amazing . That Tijuana had some bite to it i highly recommend it . As for the music there was a live band there playing some jazz at the time. Not my style but i liked it vibes.. Also there was a decent selection on vinyl that you could play.even bring your own if u like.i beleive Friday's is 80s nite . I ll be showing up then.,5-star
"Popped in for a super late lunch and catch up with a friend. I got the 6"" Katsu Dog. My friend got the 8"" Corn Dog. Hers looked exactly like a corn dog from a fair/carnival. Mine was delicious, although my only complaint was I found it a bit too salty. We also shared a small Mac and Cheese bowl with the bacon on the side. It was topped with a BBQ sauce. I liked the mix, however, I wish the cheese part was less watery and more cheesy (less Kraft and more pizza like if that makes better sense haha). Overall, the atmosphere is casual and fun. The food is good and the prices are even better. Neither of us had a drink that afternoon but the drink menu looked pretty decent. They also have a brunch menu... and it's making me salivate, so I think I will have to go check that out!",4-star
"Our waitress was Alanna and she was amazing! They knew we weren't from around here and they made us feel welcomed! She made an excellent suggestion for a choice of beer and was very attentive. My girl and I ordered the Katsu dog and Korean BBQ dog with a side of the southern (forgot what it was called but it has pulled pork) poutine! It was amazing! If you're in the area and want to try something new, definitely hit this place up. Excellent vibe, great choice of drinks and food and they let you bring in your own vinyls to play!",5-star
"College and Spadina seems to have become land of the hot dog. Let me help you make your decision: CHOOSE LET'S BE FRANK! They're the best option! I had the Doritos Taco Hot Dog, large sized. It was amazing. I did takeout and it was the most enjoyable takeout of all time. The hot dog was so well put together and the taste, disgustingly delicious. Everything you ever wanted in a hot dog. They are often empty and that's brutal because this is going to be a go-to for me from now on. Yes, it is THAT GOOD.",5-star
"Had the Mac and cheese dog w bacon. The dog was perfect, the Mac and cheese was alright. Fries were sweet with a special dry sauce. Great atmosphere inside.",4-star
"The atmosphere of this place is very chill that you'd want to stay longer even after you have eaten your hot dog. I thought I got the place wrong because it was at the back. The front of the store was a vintage stand and dj. The place is clean, friendly staff, and the seats were Retro lounges. I ordered the katsu dog and got a free order of fries courtesy of yelp check-in :D katsu dog was delicious. It has wasabi Mayo and it was just the right amount. The katsu dog was crispy. The bun is just a normal bun. Good thing that there's no trace of oil anywhere from the deep fry of the hot dog nor it's on the bun. One star down because its a bit pricey for a 3.5 inch hotdogs, it costs 4 bucks. I guess that's gourmet hotdog price. Anyhow, that doesn't stop me, I will definitely come back to this place and try the other dogs.",4-star
"I was really sceptical about trying this place ... I mean, it's a hot dog right? Nope. It's the best hot dog. I tried the one with mac & cheese on it. I originally ordered the slider (the mini version) but the waitress talked me into the regular size. It was piping hot, the mac & cheese was great, and the bbq sauce totally made the difference. (But for the record, the smaller size would have been fine.) I also tried the poutine with hot dog gravy which was pretty good but I didn't love it. But the spice that they use on the fries is awesome.",4-star
"I've been to various gourmet hotdog places, both in Toronto and elsewhere, and these are the best so far. The mac and cheese, the katsu (I think that's what it was called...it had wasabi mayo), and the corn dog were all delicious. The one with the tomato sauce and mozza cheese was forgettable and I wish I had tried something else instead of that one. The customer service was also excellent. I will definitely be back. I can only imagine how out of this world delicious these hotdogs would be if I had been inebriated.",5-star
"Today I got the Kimchi hotdog. Best hotdog I've had. Great atmosphere, good food, relaxed servers. Lots of cool options. Quick service. My girlfriend got the Mac and cheese hot dog which I tasted and it was great as well. Would definitely go again.",5-star
"So I work around College and Spadina and there are a couple of good options around for food (read Clubhouse Sandwich Shop, Fancy Franks) but I'm not one to eat at the same place everyday. Fancy Franks is good but it's a bit far to walk in -20 plus wind chill kind of weather. I had recently noticed that Let's Be Frank had opened up and liking hot dogs, I checked out their menu by the door. It seemed okay but I wasn't overly impressed (I'm sure the rundown looking outside played a part.) So at least twice, I contemplated checking it out but didn't. Working late tonight, I needed a break and some liquid relaxation. I was on my way to Red Room and noticed that Let's Be Frank is licensed. In the dark of night, I was able to see inside and saw that the interior was completely renovated and looked quite inviting. I went in for a drink over some work and ended up ordering a hot dog (Katsu) and a mac & cheese (because the one the bartender / server was having looked good) . @&#$%* What had I been missing out on? This place's dogs are better than Fancy Frank's, without a doubt. A pint of Beau's Lug Tread and a kick ass dog? Sold!",5-star
"Ok first off, the staff is amazing. Super attentive and also hilarious. Great beers on tap, mostly beau's but lots of other locals I'm canvas add well. Finally, the dogs are great and totally open to customization. I got a corn dog, which usually comes on a sick, on a bun instead and added pulled pork and our was exactly what I wanted. I would marry this establishment. Be nice to the staff they rock",5-star
Had the wings and loved the atmosphere today for lunch. Nice place to hang out. Wish I could have had a beer! But back to work I go!! Maybe next time. Very good first visit. Thank you.,4-star
"We just moved here from Ohio. We wanted to go to a low key ""local"" spot. The staff was friendly. Lots of people picking up huge trays of BBQ, so that tells you something. The brisket was okay. The pulled was awesome. Plus, they give you free hush puppies. Lots of taps and my cocktail, The Daily Ration, was great! Will definitely be back.",4-star
"Wow what bad service. After apps were eaten, approx 10-15 mins passes. Before we asked were our main food was.. All sudden it came out from different waitress and our waitress finally comes over and admits she was outside talking to friends while out food got cold. We come here every other Friday from pool and now this is 3rd instance of piss poor management. When asked to see Manager they pointed me to a bartender because Manager left already... 10pm... With hours left on a Friday night... We paid for what we ate and he gave us the 2 cold sides and a soggy taco with cold wings for free in take home boxes.. PS we left the taco. It was cold and soggy... Owner of original macs.. Please fix this.. Good food with bad management is gonna cost you your business.

"Sunday afternoon and 94°...Let's say it's beer and smoked bbq time ...after church, of course. First, early afternoon golf, go carts whatever. Then arrived around 3, hostess and wait staff attentive and friendly and fast! $1 off domestic drafts from N. Carolina, and very complete selection. Sierra Nevada summerfest purrfectly brewed and the compliment to Mac's smoked selection. First, get the wings nude and add your sauce selection after. Expertly lightly smoked with subtle dry rub,.. you may forgo sauce. Try Mac's vinegar only for a salt and vinegar flavor distinct from the standard palate. Little pig squealing good.., beef smoked sausage upscale with 2 mustard service...and plz try the greens with pork belly, after all this iz N. Carolina, ...um um um. You select sport tv channels and southern rock background tunes make this your he/shecave home away from home...Go Panthers!!!",4-star

"I might be the only person who gets annoyed as sh!t when servers call me baby, or darlin or sweetheart or Shug or what the f ever. If I am then so be it... Brandy(sp) was nice and attentive as all servers should be, but she must be used to dealing with Momma's Boys who need attention and/or lonely travelers who have a lack of self confidence and self esteem. She is the Queen of these (un)affections. If it was only for this I would have reviewed this place higher. The real problem is ""somehow"", literally everything I ordered was exactly $1 more on my bill than was listed on the menu. That's an uncanny coincidence When I mentioned this to Brandi(sp) she was sympathetic and went to see what the deal was. When she returned, she apologized, I asked her what happened and she fumbled through ""it was a computer problem."" Fair enough. Alas, I can pay my bill and leave. Goodness me, there's still an item on my bill that is exactly $1 over the menu price. I'm perplexed, yet at this point I just don't give a rat's a$$. So I pay the bill and (reluctantly) tip better than 15%, although I'm not exactly sure why? Maybe because deep down I want to believe that Brandee(sp) was innocent of any wrong doings, or maybe she has an injured feline at home who needs medical care and can't foresee another means to cover those unexpected expenses? Either way, I did my part. In Summary, *The food is average at best. *The live music was present, although I chose not to partake in the festivities because, well it's muggy and buggy and there's this weird open drain thing in the parking lot that clearly has sewage and/or feces permeating from it?!?! *Probably from the hotel next door *The service is ok if you embrace the terms of endearment. *The price is ok, just watch out you don't get pencil-whipped by that dang computer! *The drinks are drinks *The location is easy to get to *The atmosphere is biker-esque -Good Day",2-star

"I have no idea how this place isn't a 5 on everyones charts. I stayed at the Comfort Inn next door (20% discount for me at the restaurant because I stayed there). I had multiple meals here and the number one thing to get: Wings...VTX Chipotle. Amazing. It's not just the sauce though. The amazing part of the wings are they are smoked for 6 hrs. So when you go to eat them, they fall apart. Do yourself a favor and get these.",5-star
"Love love love their food, but a friend and I just went there with 4 little kids. Manager sat us. It took 12 minutes for a waitress to come over. I had to flag her down to make her come over. She took our order. Half hour later no appetizer and no food. Worst service I have ever experienced. They clearly didn't want to wait on children. They have lost my dine in business and I will tell everyone I come into contact with how rudely we were talked to and treated. Shame on your wait staff for being rude to Mom's with hungry children. I used to love sitting on the patio with a beer on a warm day.",1-star
Wonderful lunch experience with my daughter. Grilled wings were perfect. She had the salad with barbecue and I had the house Cuban. They were expertly prepared and tasted delicious. The service was impeccable and chef even came to check on how we enjoyed our food. Highly recommend,5-star
"I've been coming here for 7 years so I write this review with a heavy heart. I ordered my favorite the Brisket Sandwich but it was not as good as it used to be. Kind of dry and tough. In addition only 2 pieces. They barely covered the Texas Toast. They used to put 3 or 4 pieces on there. My friend had the pulled pork bbq sandwich. Once again nothing to write home about. I'll give the South Blvd location a shot, but some places after time just live on their reputation. You get more for your money and better tasting brisket from Midwood Smokehouse.",2-star

"Being a northern transplanted to Charlotte area. I have been hitting every BBQ place I can convince my wife to go to. Mac's is probably one our favorites at this point. We never have to wait really and it's been relatively crowded sometimes. The ribs and pulled pork hits the nail on the head. Fried pickles and the onion rings were awesome. My favorite is the smoked sausage I love it. Beer is always cold selection is top notch they have featured craft beers of the month but they also have tall boys of coors light. The service is fast like sometime a little to fast but it's alright by me I hate waiting for my food. You have 4 options for sauces mustard based, vinegar based, tomato based, and carolina style. The hush puppies are excellent and they come out before your meal so you can yes them to try sauces. They have challenge to eat a five pound sandwich which I'm working up the courage To try one day.",4-star

I'm a northerner. BBQ is way different here in the south and boy was I missing out! We love this place so much that when my family comes down they insist that we go here for lunch or dinner at least once! Never had bad service either. If I didn't like something they always remade :) This is great BBQ in Cornelius and the environment is always decent.,4-star
"Start with the off-menu hush puppies and honey butter. Move to a combo plate of ribs and pulled pork. Texas toast and baked beans are a must, also. Save some room for banana pudding - REAL banana pudding. Macs is a great BBQ joint with great live music (sometimes too loud if you just want to talk) and there are always some hogs parked out front to give it that authenticity of a biker bar. Plenty of TVs for sports if you're looking for that.",4-star
"Went here for lunch after a flag football tournament. It was a great choice because they are pet friendly considering our group had 3 dogs. Service was good, prompt, attentive to our needs but not overly in our faces. I ordered the pulled pork with a side of cole slaw and mac-n-cheese. The cole slaw was missing something, vinegar or mayo, as it was on the dry side, but still tasty. I loved the mac-n-cheese and pulled pork. I prefer the mustard BBQ sauce. Also ordered the banana pudding for dessert, I'd have to give it 2 stars because it wasn't as fresh. Bananas had turned and it was very runny. Overall I'd go back and recommend Mac's.",4-star
"This relatively new addition to the NC scene (first restaurant in 2005) is definitely of the barbecue emporium mold, offering a variety of smoked meats, and in copious amounts. There are now 5 locations, with the recent openings in Greenville and Fayetteville. This is a sports bar,upscale biker bar, good friends and family all around kind of place - large screen TVs, lots of wood, a number of ""high"" tables, as well as more traditional, and more comfortable, booths. The row of parking slots directly in front of the restaurant are reserved for motorcycles.The waitresses efficiently scurry around in cutoff jeans, and food out of the kitchen is quick. I can see why these restaurants are so popular, there is something for everyone, and it all works. Besides the smoked meats (pulled pork, brisket, wings, sausages, St Louis ribs, baby back ribs, and even smoked turkey), the menu includes sandwiches, burgers, a few salads, a few plates (like Shrimp & Grits, Fried Catfish), and a nice array of appetizers. And, of course, that have a large beer selection - bottled and on draught. We came for the meat, of course, and settled on the Whole Lot Combo Platter ($28 with 4 meats & 4 sides). Our choices were Pulled Pork, Smoked Sausages, Beef Brisket, and St Louis Style Ribs. The sides included Collards, Green Bean Casserole, Onion Rings, and FFs. Everything comes out piled on one platter (even the side dishes), which kind of makes for a train wreck, and tastes get mixed up, and some get lost - I wouldn't order a platter like this again - if I had wanted all the flavors merged I'd have ordered stew. Everything was at least pretty good, some items were excellent. The Pulled Pork was very, very good - nice smokiness, good overall flavor, though a touch dry out of the kitchen, some of the house sauce (there are 4 choices) helped this. Though I much prefer chopped pork rather than pulled ( it's a texture thing), the pork here is nice, and I'd definitely order it again. The Beef Brisket had some nice flavor, but was more heavily sauced out of the kitchen than I care for, and it was far from the most tender brisket I've tried in the area. The Smoked Sausages were excellent - nice sharp smokey flavor, well cooked. The ribs were pretty good - tender, but over-sauced for my tastes. The Collards were too sweet, and the Green Bean Casserole was buried under the ribs and brisket, and was soaked in 2 different sauces - not sure what the real taste was here. The Onion Rings were just outstanding - nice, fresh slices of sweet onion, hand cut, perfectly battered and fried. The FFs were nearly as good, and the complimentary Hush Puppies had a nice outside crust, but were a bit sweet. All in all, an enjoyable, and very filling meal. This is not a traditional NC BBQ joint in any sense of the term - though the pork is excellent. I would definitely eat here again, if in the area - reordering the pork and the sausages - and I'd probably give the brisket another go, but unless it came out more tender, with some outside crust, that would be it.",4-star
"More Texas Style Q than Carolina Don't get me wrong. I like Texas Style BBQ or for that matter, I basically like anything that is BBQ's. Some I like more than others and sometimes it comes down to the sauce. I have never quite warmed up to the Mustard Based SC style sauce. Anyway, the prime offerings center around Beef Brisket which is excellent. For those of us who are Carolinian's, they do have some great Pork offerings that are excellent. All are smoke properly and you can see the smoke ring on many pieces. Great meat. For an appetizer, I recommend at least a cup if not a bowl of their Chili/. I've had that many times and only once have a had a cup of Chili that was not up to parr. My wife normally sticks to the Mac and Cheese and it's so good, she will make a special trip to get it. The atmosphere? Cross between an upscale biker bar and Texas Roadhouse. Both work well. Lot of very expensive Harley's parked outside but maintains a Texas Hill Country Bar Atmosphere Service is very good and I have never had bad service, no matter how congested the restaurant was.

We live in Huntersville so of course Cornelius is much closer however we will travel south and get what we pay for...",1-star

Its a combo plate, and you can pick 4 meats and 2 sides. I had their pull pork and that was good. Their ribs were kinda tough. The Sausage was FANTASTIC. Their brisket was also pretty good. Lots of beer choices as well. Overall, a fun place with good BBQ and beer.",4-star

"No Jive Turkey here! (Actually, I just found out that Mac's now serves an open-faced turkey sandwich, sans the gravy). Went here w/ some out-of-town friends and their kids as they passed thru the CLT heading north on ye olde I-77. Atmosphere - Sunday afternoon busy, noisy, entertaining. Service - The girl at the front was great! I arrived before my friends did and asked if there was a booth available. She worked to get me one before they arrived and was completely pleasant about meeting our needs...even gave the kids the coloring sheets and crayons. The waitress was good, although she was a little slower on the refills than I normally like...but they were busy. Food - I had the open-faced turkey sandwich and onion rings. FYI - the hush puppies, while smaller now, come free w/ your meal. The food arrived hot and my meal consisted of two slices of Texas toast w/ a large portion of white meat turkey along w/ the tasty onion rings, side sauce, and Hopping John's (beans and rice). The turkey, while a little dry was easily moistened with the four sauces that Mac's now carry. The onion rings were great as normal and the Hopping John's was decent. One observation that my friend's wife and I made was that the side sauce that comes with the o-rings tastes like Mad's signature sauce but it is thicker and more appetizing. Next time I go, I will be placing this sauce on my pork sandwich! Price - $10 Turkey Plate. Great value for the amount of turkey I received. Overall - I had a nice experience that keeps me coming back!",4-star

"Found this place just east of the strip. It's a small bar that serves great pizza. My wife has a knack of finding these ""hole in the wall"" places. There are quite a few TVs around the bar. The decor really matches a modern style bar with a wide variety of spirits and beers. The prices for the pizza averaged $12.95 and the salad was around $5.95. Happy hour is 4-6 pm where all dine-in pizzas are 1/2 off. That's a deal!!!! We ate a spicy Hawaiian: ham, pineapple, jalapeños. If you spicy, you gotta eat this. The 2nd pizza was the Tuscan: chicken breast, spinach, garlic, red onion, mushrooms. Both pizzas had good portions of fresh toppings. The customer service was excellent. The waiter/bartender was very nice and personable. She checked on us regularly and also would also strike up a conversation. This is one of the best pizzas we've eaten, customer service was awesome, and good prices. What more can you ask for? This is a must visit. 5*****",5-star

The bar is very nice..I was surprised to see how classy of a joint it was! However I was extremely disappointed with the service! Some guy introduced himself as the bar manager and it all went downhill from there! The drinks are a bit overpriced, we came in during ""happy hour"", ordered a pizza and it was completely wrong! The manager had the pizza remade and it was wrong yet again!!! You think they would come a drink or something for the screw up! Also, one drink per $20 in gaming (I've never heard of this)..he failed to inform of us this ""rule"" and we got a hefty bill at the end! That explains why he was overly pressuring us to order drinks! The bar made me feel very uncomfortable! I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone! Classy joint but the service is not classy at all..bad food, bad manager or whatever he was, bad service, and overall just a bad experience! However, there was a drunken old blonde lady that provided quite the entertainment! Only highlight of that experience...most likely won't be going back!",1-star

"What a let down. Bought the groupon after reading reviews and looking at the website. The bar itself was clean and looked nicer than what belongs in the neighborhood. We were greeted by the bartender whom we ended up feeling very sorry for by the end of our experience. Not only was she the only bartender but was the cook as well. We were soon informed that the website wasn't correct because the owner hasn't updated it. Also, many of the items on the menu weren't available because the owner hasn't been around as he just had a baby. We ordered a pizza and wings to go and a couple of bloody Mary's while we waited. The drinks were good but the bartender was working hard because of other patrons and our food order. I overheard the bartender let other patrons know that she was out of their preferred alcohol. Now the food: the ""pizza"" was a small flat bread that got cold really fast and was served in a box usually reserved for an extra large pizza. The food is mediocre at best and there are much cooler bars to hang at downtown. Sorry, I just can't recommend to anyone. The bartender was nice though, she just didn't have the tools to do her job.",2-star

"First time ordering, and I unfortunately had a bad experience. The person on the phone told me it would be about an hour for delivery because they were backed up. I have worked at a restaurant so I understand this. After about an hour and 15 mins I patiently called to see how much longer the wait would be. The gentleman on the phone apologized and told me the order in front of us had given the wrong address, so she was delayed an additional 15 mins or so. He apologized which. Was nice, but the situation should of been nullified with more than just an apology. Another 10 mins went by and I received a call from the driver asking our location, in which she was very short and unprofessional. Another 15 mins and she finally showed up. When we playfully said to her, ""did you forget about us?"" She responded wiith, ""no. Just stupid people in front of you."" After paying her, and still tipping her an adequate 20%, I asked if my side of ranch was in the box. It wasn't. There was never an apology or so much as some way to make it up to us, like half off your next pizza. In addition, our pizza was definitely not hot by this time. Customer service could really be fine tuned. Not to mention if it takes such a long time for deliveries, they might want to consider additional delivery driver to a) nullify situations like this, and b) ease up longer delivery wait times during rush hours.",1-star
"they get 5 stars because they are as good as they get. So glad I happened to stumble upon them a month ago. took my boyfriend with his discriminating NY pizza taste buds. Even he was impressed. Pizzas was balanced with just the perfect amount of sauce, cheese, meat (for him) and veggies (for me). Had their Caesar salad which was delish!! Had such a great evening there. Relaxing in a bar with a sophisticated ambiance but no pretentiousness there. Had such a pleasant experience that I decided to throw a surprise birthday party for a friend there. Unbeknownst to me they will post photos, a playlist, video messages and a birthday message on their large screen T.V.'s for a special touch. They even let us go the extra mile and put up our balloons, flamingos, have our own cake and let us add our own touch. This all made for a very special evening and everyone loved it. I kept asking all of our guests what they thought of the food and everyone of them enjoyed the delicious pizza, salads (by the way, I highly recommend the Midtown). Kevin and Roland really hit a home run with us. Without any reservation, I recommend Midtown for a special evening. They are truly a hidden gem. I want everyone to know about them. We have a downtown here in Vegas now let's make Midtown the place to be with swanky joints like this. I also love the fact that they don't have gaming only because its refreshing and you don't think you're in Vegas when you are there. If I can recommend anything, I would recommend that they have some vegetarian appetizer options such as zucchini strips, or some type of veggie dish for us Veggies/Vegans. Other than that, give them a whirl for your next shindig. You'll be pleasantly surprise.",5-star
Lobter pizza is a joke. Hope the owner knows that his pizza maker doesn't care about his business at all. My pizza had like 5 tiny pieces of lobster. 1 on each slice.,1-star
"This spot is bullshit. They said 45 mins I waited 2 hrs, no show.unprofessional and unbelievable ! This would not fly in LA, get real people. If you're going to say 45 mins it better be 45 mins or less. Not over 2 hrs!! What a disgrace. I was going to leave a nice review but heres to you KEVIN, who took my order. f**k you AssHole! NEVER AGAIN!",1-star
The pizza these guys make is fantastic. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere nice a chill. These guys are vegan friendly which is a plus.,5-star
"Great people, great ambiance and even better food. I love how I can pick the music that plays. Makes it like my own bar, feels good here. Check this new place out, it's worth it!",5-star
"I love this bar and what it's trying to become! The owner and tenders are all extremely friendly and seem genuinely happy to see you. The drinks have great prices and the atmosphere is perfect. I know business may be a bit slow for them, but my roomies and I try to pop in at least once a week. Help give these guys a shot!!! Oh and wine Wednesday? Give that a shot! Also be sure to check out happy hour Monday- Thursday 4-7. 5 dollar specialty drinks :D",5-star
"Super cute place! My friend actually painted the designs on the outside of the building, super cute! We did not eat here we just met some friends for drinks. Hubby and I shared a bottle of Merlot and it was appropriately priced at about $20. I really love the decor in here and there tv's are hung in a fashion that watching a game would be easy. They have a ""Wine Wednesdays"" plan coming up so I will def go to that when they start it :) I will update my review the next time I go!",4-star
"This place rocks!! The minute I walked in the door to pickup my pizza, which was awesome btw, I was greeted at the door by the owner Kevin. You would have thought I was one of his long time regular customers. I was a little early and my pizza wasn't quite ready so I ordered a drink at the bar. Immediately I felt like I was back home in my regular watering hole, everyone was friendly and were glad I was there. I ended up eating my pizza there which I will have say was excellent, cooked to perfection you would have thought I was in NYC having a pizza in the Broncz. I ended up staying 3 hours and had one the best times I have ever had in Vegas. This place is a must for your place to visit while in town or if you live here you need to check it out before the line is so long you will have to wait an hour or more to be seated. I will defiantly be putting this place on my short list of places that are a must visit every time I am in town. Great job Kevin and staff keep up the great work.",5-star
"Dude, came here on Saturday night at 11:30 and it was closed, WTF? I give 2 stars because a closed bar can't defend itself and who knows, it could have been awesome?",2-star
"Midtown disappointed me. If my friends and I weren't so timid and nice we would have walked out. What they advertise online- hours and menu items- is not accurate. They didn't have fries. It didn't look like they had pastries or coffee. Numerous things we asked for that were actually on the menu were out. No beer on tap. When we ordered sliders we got one, well, slider. I do have to say that the lobster pizza was really good. My husband and I shared our slider and the pizza. It was about $20 for that and we were not full so I don't recommend sharing. The waitress was having all kinds of problems processing our transaction. I felt embarrassed that we made our friends go there with us.",2-star
Came for lunch on a Monday & had the Thai Chicken pizza. Very tasty! Appreciated the julienne vegetables & chicken and wasn't too spicy. Crust could have been a little crisper; will ask them to leave in oven a few extra minutes next time. They get a gold star for having Coke products and I got a lemon in my diet Coke without asking. Bartender was polite and efficient. I did get there a little early (11:30 am) and their meatballs weren't quite ready and I may have those next time. Overall great experience. Parking appeared to be limited; I counted about 11 - 12 spots and don't know how it would work if they were busy as there's no street parking on Desert Inn here. I'll be back!,4-star
"The moon hit my eye like a big pizza pie and it was amore after visiting this place. A hidden gem by Boulevard Mall- this is the spot for pizza. Carne Asada or Margherita Pizza are served piping hot with a side of awesome bartender. Forget Metro Pizza, Midtown is much more chic and a place for adults to dine without the hustle bustle of families with children. On Wednesdays they have half off bottles of wine! Stay tuned for future check-ins because this is my new spot for a pizza pie.",5-star
"I would give this place 3.5 stars. Came to this place because I pass it on the way to work. It looks like a cool, hip, place to hang out and it definitely seems like it should be on the strip of bars downtown. They also advertise they sell coffee, pastries 24 hours but when we went there, the pastry case wasn't set up and lit, and to my dismay the poor pastries were suffocating in saran wrap sitting in the pastry case. The interior decor was very modern and everything was new. Since it recently opened (~3weeks from when we visited), there were empty spaces on the walls where the TVs should have been. The gaming wasn't installed yet either. Service was OK. Our bartender wasn't really knowledgeable about the drinks on hand and right away we noticed they only had Guinness on tap- which happened to be out that night but we only discovered that after we ordered the Guinness. I noticed that the owner/manager was there, he helped our bartender find the wine that I had ordered because she had no clue where it was. The place we extremely lit. I would have appreciated it more if it was a little dimmer. I'm a big fan of the low light setting, because it doesn't feel like someone could watch your every move. For food, we ordered two different pizzas: 1. The Midtown- classic margarita pizza, the pizza was really good the tomatoes were giant chunks. 2. Lobster pizza was definitely a hit! It's probably the main reason I would come back here. There were chunks of tasty lobster on top (not tiny little pieces as you would expect) and for a wooping $15 the pizza was totally worth it. No where on the strip could you find a lobster pizza at that price and that tasty. I totally recommend this pizza! I'd come back in a couple of months when everything is set up a little better.",3-star
"Stopped for a quick lunch after flying into L V and used yelp for restaurant suggestions. Found Midway easily & the decor is wam & welcoming. But the staff & owner were even more wonderful, very attentive & appreciated our patronage . The sandwiches, pizza, specials were great. And we enjoyed ""trying out"" the pastries which were light & tasty. Really enjoyed the meal & you will too! Cozier than most places in in Las Vegas! Give it a try.",5-star
"so far so good! great looking place, nice bar, and the the pizza i had was awesome! i will definitely be back, especially since it is only a few blocks away.",5-star
"It's a cool little new spot that is part bar, restaurant, coffee, that is open 24 hours! So basically almost everything you need anytime of day. There is a bar and tables with very comfortable seating, think plush. The music is both jukebox or radio top 40. They plan on installing more TVs soon and in the end it would be a total of 6, making it a pretty awesome sports bar. I think they are going to make a killing once the LV convention center attendees catch wind of this place. For sure it beats the food court! (Correction, I wasn't driving so I thought we were closer to the Convention Center. It's a bit of a walk but I think worth it) Food wise, they have salads, pizzas, and some appetizers. We came from dinner so I didn't eat anything. They have a Lobster Pizza that's supposed to be their specialty... next time.",5-star
Back again great food at a reasonable price. Will be back. Wifi Great. It's Easter this time and food just as great as ever.,5-star
"Good for Lunch after Church. Gone for Lunch a couple of times here but first time going after Church. Had a few minutes to kill since they don't open till 11 am but as soon as the doors opened, we were immediately seated. Wait Staff was a bit slow at the start but not unusual just after opening but quickly improved. I ordered the Steak and Lobster Tail with Baked Potato which my wife had her Alice Springs Chicken. Both were good although the rub they use on the steak could be toned down a bit. Nice fax Aussie atmosphere but still a fun place.",4-star
"So disappointed, this is my first and last time at this location. Ordered the Bourbon Salmon and loaded baked potato. The bourbon sauce was cold teriyaki salt that made the salmon way too salty, so much so I'm sure it raised my blood pressure and the potato was dry. The sad part, while the restaurant was completely empty, the waiter didn't even bother to notice or ask why I hadn't eaten my food. Get it together outback!!!",1-star
"I highly recommend not going to eat at Outback unless you like cheap food with an expensive price. I went earlier today( had a very nice server), started out with the bread being old and stale ( I guess due to it being 3 o clock nothing was fresh). I ordered the chicken tenders, which I DO NOT recommend, they were frozen Tyson chicken tenders that I fix at my house for $5 a bag!! Also, my friend ordered the sirloin which was decent for it obviously being frozen low quality meat. Only good thing about the mean was the service and the potatoes! Not to mention the mean was $40!!",1-star
"We were in town visiting for a baby shower and staying at the Courtyard Marriot just down the street. Too tired to go out and sit down for food we decided to order curbside from Outback. After going on their mobile website (which had no prices listed so that was annoying) we ordered a 6oz steak with side salad and fries and a cobb salad with sauteed mushrooms and macaroni sides. We were quoted 25 minutes. We got there after 30 minutes and then waited another 5 minutes before anyone came out to help us. They had messed up our order on the receipt so after that was straightened out we waited another 10 minutes for our food to come out. My salad and two sides cost me $30 whereas my friend's steak cost less than $15. Since the waitress hadn't brought out our itemized receipt with our bills I asked for one. When I saw that indeed, my salad and sides cost me $30 I was extremely confused and annoyed but too tired to care at that point. Tired and hungry we went back to the hotel to eat. When I pulled out my salad it was actually smaller than the side salad given to my friend and only had shredded cheese and a little bit of bacon bits on it. How is that considered an entree sized cobb salad? I was SO annoyed I'd just paid $30 for a tiny excuse of a cobb salad. What little there was to eat also tasted so bland. What a waste. It's been years since I've been to an Outback but after this experience I doubt I'll ever go back to any Outback ever again. Also noticably lacking from our bag of food was a single utensil or napkin. I guess they expect us to eat with our fingers? I should've learned my lesson from Lethal Weapon: ""They F YOU at the drive-thru, okay? They F YOU at the drive-thru! They know you're gonna be miles away before you find out you got effed! They know you're not gonna turn around and go back, they don't care. So who gets effed? Ol' Leo Getz! Okay, sure! I don't give a F""",1-star
"Well, it's not like we were searching out some gem to eat at.... we have been to Outback hundreds of times. Tonight was just a total nightmare. We waited a good 15-20 minutes just to have a table wiped down so we could sit down. We ordered 2 appetizers, a soup and 2 salads, + a meal. Before we got 1 appetizer, we were about an hour in. Still no sign of other appetizer. Ahi Tuna appetizer was good, but incredibly small pieces for $10. About hour and a half in we got salads. My wedge ""premium salad"" was soaking wet lettuce. Literally water on the entire bottom of plate. Waiter buzzed by a few times and ensured us stuff was on the way throughout the time. Manager stopped by and was very sweet and accommodating. She said she would love to treat us to a free dessert, and if we didn't want dessert, she still wanted to look at our bill and see what she could do for us. Funny thing is, we never complained once. I guess she just knew that it was kind of a shitshow? Chicken was very tiny portion with soggy bacon and no mustard-sauce. Wife's soup ice cold by the time it came. Stale croutons on her salad. She barely ate anything as it was pretty bad, and we were tired (both nurses coming off 12 hour shifts. We decided we would opt for a dessert, but manager never came back, and thus we got charged for it, (it was also sub par). Bathroom was filthy! Not sure if they're understaffed, or we just caught them on a bad night. It was busy, but not anything crazy. For the price (about $60) I have had better meals/portions at Chilis for half the price. Kind of a bummer. About 2 hours + start to finish. Not sure we will be back to this location.",1-star
"Well, I spoke with corporate and it was awesome that they tried to reconcile the wreck of the to-go service and order we received however.. the meal was $142.32 and they're idea of reconciling was sending us a $20 gift card. Unfortunately, that was a sad attempt at regaining business from us, and I don't think at this point we'll be back.",1-star
"Outback is probably my favorite chain restaurant and my SO and I eat at one whenever we can. Last time I was in Concord for work, this location was still under construction... boy was I excited when I arrived in town last week to find out it was open! I got on ""the list"" at Outback.com and was told our table would be ready at 7:45. We arrived around 7:40 and the place was packed, which is to be expected at any respectable dining choice within a stone's throw of a mall the week before Christmas! I checked in with the girl at the door and she gave me one of those buzzer things. We waited about 25 minutes before I asked the hostess how much longer we could expect to wait. I wasn't in any hurry, just genuinely curious since it seemed my online ""spot"" in the ""line"" meant nada. She said they were just waiting for some parties to leave so they could seat those of us still waiting. Noticing some empty seats at the bar, I told her that was ok and to go ahead and take us off the list. Service at the bar was great, the two bartenders that waited on us were attentive and extremely nice. All of our food all arrived SUPER fast, which blew me away considering how busy they were! The food is always good, so no complaints there. The decor in this location is really neat, and rather updated compared to the long-standing Outbacks I frequent here at home. I'm glad to have this place so close to where I stay when I'm in town for work and I'll definitely be back!",4-star
"Went here with a family party of 5. Service was good, food for the others seemed ok. We ordered a blooming onion floating in grease. They should at least put it on a drain rack and paper towel before serving. I was extremely disappointed in the grass fed burger I ordered as I am partial to steak. Menu states aged cheddar lettuce, tomato, onion, garlic aioli. It came as Luke warm patty, dry top bun, some sort of dressing on the bottom and very little grated lettuce, nothing else. It is my fault I did not send it back as I was unsure of how the menu read in the beginning. When we mentioned it on the way out, the hostess apologized and gave us a coupon for a free blooming onion, which by the way expired in April 2016",2-star
We sat at the bar on a very busy Thursday night. We had the pleasure of having Brandon as our server. It was obvious the night was busy as other servers asked for drink orders while Brandon ran the bar top full of patrons. As an ex server I noticed his computer system was giving him a lot of issues but he kept a clear head. Happy I came in tonight to see such a hard working individual who works with great heart. A patron left her card and Brandon ran after her.. with a full bar and drinks needing to be filled he did the right thing and put forth the extra effort.,5-star
Very good! Enjoyed myself. They meat was good. Veggies as well. My drink wasn't strong enough. And that's why it for 4 out of 5 stars. I will be back its near the whole foods.,4-star
Never again! This time went to a different outback on a different town. Service - slooow. Wait long. Food so-so. Price expensive. Like I said never again.,1-star
"Wrong order came out and then when the right food came out it was terrible. Do not order the stuffed mushrooms, Tasted like a mushy tasteless bread, no flavor whatsoever. Also the blooming onion was about half the size they usually are. Will never be back. Sad to see these chains skimp out on there food",2-star
"I'm not one to ""return food"", although I regret not sending my plate back this time. All I wanted was soup and a decent steak. That being said, my soup was fine. The filet, however, may have been one of the worst I've come across in a chain in a long time. The quality was mediocre...and my ""medium rare"" filet came out pretty much grey, with hints of light pink here and there. I cut through that thing, looking for any sign of deliciousness...and none was found. Throughout my ""bite searching"", I was never asked how the steak was. Which is probably another reason I didn't send it back. I figured they'd pick up on my disappointment. This is a friggen steak house after all, no?? Anyway, the bartender came and got my plate when I told her I was ""all set"". She scraped off my ""scraps"" (my 20$ steak cut up into multiple grey pieces) into the trash and didn't say one thing. Okay, so I'm thinking ""maybe chocolate could make this better...I'll order dessert and just write it off as 'not my day for steak'"". Well...here comes the bill. Guess I'm not having anything else? Such a disappointing visit all together. Basically, we're looking at 43 bucks for broccoli, bread, and two drinks. And a waste of good. Come on now, guys. Get your sh*t together...both front and back of the house.",2-star
I have always loved going to Outback Steakhouse for as long as I can remember. The last few times I feel the food quality has dropped in a major way. My wife and I ordered a Blooming Onion that was much smaller the last couple of times then previous visits. The taste was ok but still not it was. I also ordered the hot wings The wings were barely eatable The quality of chicken seemed poor and it was very dried out. I am not sure if it's a local resturant issue or if all Outback quality has dropped. I know with the rising cost of food the resturant business have raised their prices but it seems the quality of food has suffered to. I will be in no hurry to go back anytime soon. That's sad as I always liked them before.,2-star
"Very good service. Friendly, timely, and attentive. My steak was prepared perfectly and had lots of flavor. The asparagus was prepared the way I requested and seasoned to my request. My salad was very fresh. No chocolate thunder from down under, but I'm sure it would have been delicious also. Great job to the team.",5-star
"The food was good, filet/lobster and outback special. Unfortunately, it was WAY too loud; the waiter for the next table was bending over talking to the table beside us and kept putting his butt in my face. He had a napkin hanging out from his belt or pocket and it came very close to going into my glass of water. He was completely oblivious and when my fiancé said, ""excuse me, you have your butt in my fiancee's face"", rather than apologizing, he glared. Two of the four forks wrapped in napkins were dirty with food particles on them and it took longer than average for waitress to initially come to our table, to deliver bread and to refill drinks. Despite the tasty food, we will probably not be going back for a while.",2-star
"A truly mixed review. I enjoy a good steak every now and then. I have been to this Outback location a few times now, and it seems while I eat in the restaurant, my steaks and meals seem to come out as ordered with no issues. Ordering out though has continuously been a disappointment on more than one occasion. This past Monday was Labor Day, and we decided to order out and call in some steaks since we figured the restaurants would be busy and my niece and nephew were a little too wired to have a quiet dinner out. In total, we ordered 4 steak dinners: 2 of the largest size Outback Specials - one MEDIUM and one Medium Rare, 1 small Outback Special cooked MEDIUM, and another steak (I forget which cut and size) also cooked Medium Rare. We also put in for side salads, loaded baked potatoes, and an extra side of asparagus (which we paid for). What we RECEIVED was nothing but disappointing. I received 4 HORRIBLY undercooked steaks, no asparagus, and and a missing side of mushrooms. When I say these steaks were undercooked, I mean I had to check them for a pulse to make sure they weren't going to jump off the counter top and head to the back yard to graze!!! Im no Outback cook, but I can tell by the TOUCH when a steak is basically RAW on the inside. These steaks were so soft to the touch there is no way they could have been considered rare. Cutting into each one proved my theory... all were basically raw on the inside. This isn't the first time this has happened. EVERY time we have used their curbside to go, we have had things missing, steaks undercooked, etc. We HATE calling in, but after this last time, we pretty much expect the order to be wrong or undercooked. I actually had to re-cook the steaks in the oven (375 degrees for almost 9 minutes to get mine back to a proper MEDIUM - pink center.... not walking dead red!!!) The manager was very sympathetic and comp'd our meal, which was nice, but still.... why is it that EVERY TIME we call out for dinner, something is wrong? Is it that tough for a steak restaurant to cook a steak properly??? I attached pictures of my barely dead cow slices.",2-star
"I'm not sure when outback got so expensive but never again. $45 for curbside and we didn't even get steak. Alice chicken, pasta with chicken and some $10 cheese fries. Ridiculous! Food was a little over cooked even. Outback needs to step back down from these high prices. They are not a fancy restaurant. What happened?",3-star
"Outback is one of the good chains where you can actually enjoy a good meal. The decor has an emphasis on ""Australia"" I guess since I've never been there there's usually a wait on the weekends, but everything runs smoothly, you can sip some complimentary lemonade from the pitcher at the front door or order wine from the bar. Food comes out consistently good and the servers are polite. The parking lot here is shared with carabbas so it may take a minute to find your spot.",4-star
"Kids like to eat here and we've always had good experiences at the Huntersville location. The staff is friendly and the service has always been above average. Food is what you would expect at Outback, a decent cut of meat for a very reasonable price. It does get pretty busy on the weekends, but we generally go before 5:30 and rarely have to wait.",4-star
"I am tired of spending 300 bucks at Morton's and Capital Grille for a steak. This place is great. My fiancé and I had 2 appetizers, 2 drinks each and each got a big ole steak and potato dish. Total bill 70 bucks. I gave the girl a 20 dollar tip because she was great. She almost passed out because people in the greater Charlotte Market are cheap and do not tip properly. BUT I DO.",5-star
"Food was great, but the service was the worst I have ever experienced. We were ignored from the moment we were sat. No refills, no one checked on us, and we had to ask for bread four times.We sat down for our meal 2.5hrs before closing time and our server was busy cleaning up and outside smoking. We had to stop all the other servers to get items we needed like a box and the check. Waiting over 20mins for bread and being ignored is disappointing.",1-star
"Outback is still the gold standard for chain restaurants. Been awhile since visiting this location. The newer decor was very warm and inviting. Not much for the combo add-ons, just like to 9oz fillet with a standard baked potato. My son enjoyed the half rack of ribs and our waitress was wonderful. Will come back soon.",5-star
"It's been years since I have been out an Outback and you know, I don't know it has been so long! I forgot what a great place Outback is if you are looking for a meal at a larger chain. My boyfriend and I ate at the bar and we enjoyed very pleasant, quick service. I had the Outback Classic and he had the Ahi Tuna and both were prepared and cooked perfectly; I was truly impressed! It was just the right amount of food and I didn't feel like I just consumed a processed mess. It may not be high on my places to re-visit (I like t frequent locally owned places as much as I can) but I look forward to coming back in the future!",4-star
"Decided to have dinner here, it is always busy there on weekends. make sure u call ahead. we still ended up waiting 25 minutes once we got there. time went by fast. I ordered the sirloin and grill shrimp with house salad which was delicious with vegetables hubby ordered the tuna grill rare . My sirloin was over cooked well done I had told the server. He took care of it right away and order me another one medium. The second one came out perfect and also gave me another serving of vegetables. They even gave me a free desert ice cream with chocolate syrup with Oreo on top with whip cream for the inconvenience. Great customer service and the manager came over to make sure everything is fine. Highly recommend this place. !",4-star
"So it had been a while since me and Outback had a date. Not sure when they got the new menu but it was a bit confusing. I just wanted my classics! After I located my usual selections, we ordered the Bloomin' Onion. It was a bit smaller than usual. The outer layer was more onion skin than it was actual onion. The prime rib is now seasoned, and I have to say, I didn't care for it. I liked the natural flavors. However, I'm not going to deduct starts for that since the menu change isn't location specific. What I will say about this Outback is that we received excellent service. Our waiter was on top of our drinks, brought more dipping sauce out before we even asked for it, and checked in with us often. I'd definitely go back to this particular Outback!",4-star
"When it comes to steakhouse chain restaurants, Outback is pretty darn close to the top. I've always had a good quality steak there and rarely ever had a problem with service. This location was no different. We were in at a little after 5:30, so I guess we were ""early birds"" since it was pretty dead. Our waitress came over and took our orders quickly. I decided to try something non-steaky since I had a steak the other night, and went with the pork chop. It was a decent size of meat, probably between 6-8oz, and I had the mashed potatoes and a side caesar salad. My wife got a shrimp caesar salad entree, but it only came with five shrimp, so she was kind of bummed about that skimpiness. Overall, good food and good service makes it a pretty good place to grab a steak...if there isn't a Texas Roadhouse anywhere nearby!",4-star
"I'm pretty happy with this Outback, as they're consistenly good. Yummy in my tummy meal is the outback special, loaded baked potato & the house salad. Oh & the bloomin onion of course. Their sweet tea is good, too. The steak is a generous portion & cooked perfectly to my choice of medium well. The wait staff are friendly & attentive & the resturaunt is always clean. The manager is always there when I am, so she stops by to check on me, which I like that aspect.",4-star
"I was staying close by this location on a Saturday night, so I walked over there for dinner. The wait was minimal, and I was directed to my table in 10 minutes. My waiter was good. He kept polite conversation going while making sure I was served quickly as well as those at his other tables. Ordered the 14oz. Ribeye. Unusual for me to go for that large of a steak, but I went for it - and ate the whole thing! Cooked perfectly and great taste. The restaurant was busy and the staff worked seemlessly to make it a good experience for all. Well Done!",4-star
"My husband and I had discovered this restaurant at 2012's Fiestaval in Red Deer where we live. We had GREAT tacos there and took a menu home with us since we were back and forth to Calgary so often. We are from San Diego and I'm Mexican so we KNOW what REAL, authentic Mexican food is. We finally got a chance to go to this restaurant yesterday (5/4/13) and I'm sad to say we were beyond disappointed! We were super happy when we were automatically served homemade chips and salsa. The chips were fantastic and the salsa was spicy and so yummy. But that's where our good experience ended. We waited 20 minutes for our menus. Then we waited a half an hour for our food. SInce we had such a great experience with the tacos previously, I ordered the 3 taco platter of carne asada that came with rice and beans. All that came on the tacors were white onions and cilantro with the tiniest limes that were dry and had no juice. I wasn`t asked if I wanted a specific salsa or guacamole and was actually charged for a side of guac. The rice had no taste what -so-ever and the refried beans tasted like they came out of a can. I can make better food at home for less $!! My daughter had the chicken quesadillas and I tried them. They were bland. My husband had a carne asada burrito and 1, it had rice in it and no guacamole. Again, we were charged for a side of it. He said it was okay. Mexicans DO NOT put rice in burritos and if you ever get rice in your burrito, they are using it as a filler so they don`t give you more of the good stuffl like meat! In this restaurant`s defense, it is a CHILEAN restaurant. If this is chilean food, I`ll take good Mexican anyday! We won`t be going back. A HUGE disappointment. On top of the boring food, the service was horrible, the waitress didn`t know the menu and we weren`t given basic things like menus, napkins, silver ware, etc. For Canadians, I`m sure this palce is great because you don`t know better. For us, it was AWFUL.",1-star
"Paloma is one of those great restaurants that one could drive past over and over without giving it a second look. While it's certainly not in one of the most scenic locations (close to Whitehorn station) that is all forgotten once you step inside. I went on a Saturday night and my first impression was that the atmosphere was very pleasant and comfortable. Then I sat down and grabbed one of their complimentary, home made tortilla chips and dipped it into the neighbouring bowl of what could be the greatest home made salsa I have ever been privelaged to taste! Feeling not too adventerous, I ordered the Beef Fajita and devoured the hell out of the dish. Oh and I also tried the guacamole that my friend had ordered - it was exquisite! In November they are having a tequila and live band night that ought to be a blast, so I'll definately be back for more. If you like Mexican (and they also have a few Chilean dishes) do yourself a favour and go here! This is one of those rare places you can spend 3 hours in with your friends without even realizing how the time flew by. More than just a fantastic restaurant, but also a great experience!",5-star
"This is the closest to a ""real"" Mexican restaurant that I've found in Calgary. I lived in Austin for years before moving to Calgary and I have truly missed the restaurants there. I knew I would love it when they brought a free basket of chips to the table. Oh and they were REAL chips cut from tortillas and fried....not bagged chips. We had a creamy dip with them instead of a classic salsa. It was very reminiscent of Chuy's creamy jalapeno dip (in Austin) and it was DELICIOUS. Paloma has an $8.95 lunch special Tues-Saturday. Today it was the Taco platter. I decided to shake things up and try 3 different tacos. All were delicious and served on two corn tortillas with a side of rice and beans. I decided to leave off one of the tortillas on each taco because I was STUFFED. I will definitely be making the trek to the Northeast frequently to visit Paloma again in the future. Oh and btw....it was empty at lunch. We should throw this place some love so that it sticks around!",5-star
"I couldn't possibly love this place more! We went on a Friday night and it was dead but this restaurant should be PACKED! The service is wonderfully warm and friendly, the food is flavourful, and the prices are great. I can't remember everything we had but it was my boyfriend's first time enjoying mole sauce and he was blown away! We also had the prawn appetizer and it was to die for! We stuck to the mexican portion of the menu and could not have been more pleased. Paloma is the kind of place you want to go back to over and over again! We went out for dinner the following weekend and I found myself wishing we'd just gone back to Paloma! If you like Mexican, try Paloma!",5-star
"Is it possible to have real Mexican food in Calgary? It's been hard for me to find some real good tacos for a while now and Paloma does not disappoint. The portions are good and Jarritos are not over priced. For a good down to Earth family experience, go to Paloma. I've had just about all the popular Mexican eats in town and Paloma is as authentic as it gets.",4-star
"We ate at Paloma for the first time tonight. Previously I had sampled their tostadas at the Crossroads Market. Both meals were very good! The service was fast and friendly and the main dining room was very cheerful. Dinner and dessert for my husband and I I came to $32 before tip. I had the fish tacos on special and they were very tasty. I liked the spicy chipotle mayo on them. The portion was very generous - rice, refried beans and three tacos. There is a wide selection of Mexican sodas and desserts too. There is a lounge next door, but we did not check it out. It's so good to eat real Mexican food again! We will be back to try something new!",5-star
"I had no idea there was a Mexican / Chilean restaurant in Whitehorn! The place is nicely decorated with Mexican and Chilean paraphernalia, hats, ponchos, very brightly decorated. They serve you tortilla chips with a mild spicy green sauce. There's two menus, A Chilean and a Mexican one. I sampled from the Chilean Menu, had a Chacarero (steak on a bun with mayo, guacamole, green beans and tomato) served with a tomato and cilantro salad on the side. my girl had the Flautas (chicken taquitos, refried beans with rice) for dessert we had a nice sweet raspberry cheesecake with Cajeta (dulce de leche) and Caneladas (baked sweet chips presented With vanilla ice cream, drizzled in honey and powdered with cinnamon) absolutely to die for. Reasonable prices, quick service, just another little gem in the NE for you to check out. 2 min walk from Whitehorn Station.",5-star

"I only go there because I love Applewood Smoke Burger which inside the same location. Otherwise, I would never go back to this place. The bar has an OK draft list, usually one local option at least (East End Big Hop from what I've seen). I've had issues with the service - slow in general as if the bartenders don't really care, ignoring people who have been there awhile to take a drink order from someone new to the bar, no bartender for awhile b/c the person feels like going outside to smoke, etc. I also really dislike that a couple times I've been there, there was very loud screamo type music playing, which was a huge turn off to me.",2-star
"Holy cow, what a burger. I can't begin to describe what a wonderful burger the Applewood burger was. Large and juicy, and the sauce was amazing. Fries were good as well! The food staff was really nice even though we walked in a half hour before they closed the kitchen. Music was great, tons of throwbacks, but a bit loud and made it hard to hear my friend. Overall, great eating experience.",4-star
"Came here on a lazy Friday early evening with a friend who is a Highland Park denizen. I run up and down Bryant frequently, but this laidback joint had never caught my eye. We got our beers (Stella on special being a perfectly refreshing choice on a hot afternoon) and sat outside on their new deck, which was roomy and offered ample opportunity for people watching. A huge bonus of Park Place Pub is their partnership with Applewood Smoke Burger Company (reviewed separately). Highly recommended for a low-key happy hour/night out.",4-star
"I stopped at Park Place Pub twice, both before eating at Park Bruges. The first time there I thought the bartender was nice. She got us a couple of beers and we caught some of the hockey game while waiting for our table to open up next door. Averaged prices for craft beers. The last time there was this past Sunday. We stopped in, not because of a wait next door since it was mid-afternoon, but because we wanted to catch the end of the Bucco game. The waitress was a little less pleasant than the first one, but still not bad. We only stayed for two, as the game went into extra innings, and left. I would return primarily just for drinks. The bar and place are cute and it does have that small town pub feel. I was really digging some of their décor, especially the Beer steins, since I happen to be an avid collector.",3-star
This is a nice looking bar and adjoining burger company. Mostly a local bar and a good stop for a drink or to watch the game. Nothing particularly notable though.,2-star
Really? This is the second time I've been to a neighboring establishment to have brunch outside and been disturbed by leaf blowing. If this is your way of making a point then it's not working. I am disinclined to stop in for a beer or try the burger after having my brunch ruined by gas exhaust fumes. This is bad for business and makes Bryant St look bad. It makes you look bad. The leaf blowing can wait until Monday. Really. Be a good neighbor and reap the reward. Behave like this and you will get what you deserve!,1-star
Only stopped in here for drinks after eating dinner at Park Bruges. It's a bar with about 6 tables. The bar smelled smoky. I can only speak for the drinks and have no idea about the food. We sat at the only open table which would seat 6. It happened to be dirty. We sat there for about 20 minutes with our drinks we got from the bar before anyone came to clean the table. If you want food it looks like you order it at the counter. Saw the bartender go stand outside for a smoke break and then return to work without washing her hands. I would not come back even if someone told me the food is awesome.,2-star
"Park Place Pub is a neighborhood dive bar that contains an incredible burger place called Applewood Smoke Burger Company. The combination of these two businesses under the same roof creates an interesting symbiotic relationship. In all honesty, I come here for the burgers first and the drinks second, but the pub has a nice dive-y charm, a juke box that's usually on point ( I recall standing outside the front door of the pub with ""Don't Look Back in Anger"" spilling out onto the street), and a decent selection on tap. If you don't feel like sitting at home to watch the game, just go over to Park Place Pub, order yourself a ridiculous burger (I'm talking better than BRGR, Burgatory, Stack'd, etc.), grab a beer and enjoy. Yours Truly, A Highland Park resident",4-star
"I live a couple blocks from here and never went in because it was always empty but times have changed! This place is becoming a totally cool neighborhood hangout with some fine bartenders, namely Caleb, and a kick ass burger joint that leases in the back. Chef James rocks it! Great juke box, lots of laughs, you will feel right at home. Alone or with friends, this is a highland park ""cheers"". Also open on holidays if you need a place to get away from family!! Been there xmas eve and it was much needed.",4-star
"The new proprietors of the kitchen have successfully created the most delicious burger I've ever tasted. The burgers consist of different hand ground cuts of free range, hormone free beef. The French fries are double blanched and double fried that guarantees a crisp, yummy fry. The onion rings are cut to order, the tempura batter light and the homemade dipping sauce is perfect. Stop in ask for James (he's one of the new owners of kitchen and the head chef)...",5-star

"I went to Park Place Pub and ordered the fish and chips appetizer. I just wanted a small bite to eat and didn't want to spend too much so I chose this place over Park Bruge. It was also my first time in the Bryant Street area. If I had read these reviews first, I definitely would've skipped it. I'm giving it two stars because the bartender/waitress was really nice. Otherwise, I would be giving it one star for the food and experience. I got a generous serving of fries, but the fish was gross. When I pulled it apart the fish was barely discernible. Not even a hint of flaky white meat. Instead I found was a super flat and grey filet. Basically I was paying for batter and fries. I told the waitress that the fish didn't look right and I didn't want it. She couldn't even say anything. She took it away. I briefly entertained the thought of ordering something else off the menu but decided against it. I won't be back.",2-star
"Like a handful of the other reviewers to date, I consider Park Place Pub to be the only no-fuss bar in Highland Park (I think Park Bruges is the only other contender, though). Even though East Liberty and Shadyside are within walking distance on a fair day, it's nice to have a place to get a beer in the neighborhood. Bryant Street has an odd vibe--it's a mix of public housing (or at least I've been told that is what occupies the building across the street from Park Place) and several upscale restaurants, with a bakery and a small grocery store mixed in. It's strange to see glossy middle-aged couples in cardigans on the patio at Park Bruges or E2 while less-than-polished-looking individuals chain smoke on the sidewalk across the street. That being said, I'm glad that the businesses are there and appear to be doing well, and I hope the street continues to develop (with more independent, not commercial, businesses, of course). Park Place itself looks really nice, I think. It's comparable to the other businesses on Bryant--new and clean. I agree with other reviewers who have commented the atmosphere would be more cozy if the two flat screen TVs mounted high above the bar weren't such a focal point, but if that's what the regulars want, sure, whatever. For being a pretty quiet bar most of the time, there does seem to be a steady stream of regulars; I've gotten the feeling that their presence is part of the reason why I don't always get the most attentive service when I'm there. While each of the few bartenders (I've maybe had three) has always been friendly, I definitely agree with some other reviewers' concerns that there needs to be a better sense of customer service there. I've walked in when no one seems to be around at all, or have been waiting for another beer or a tab when the bartender is nowhere to be seen (in which case she is usually outside on the phone or smoking). I get that it must be boring when business is slow, but it's simply unprofessional to wander off frequently and/or for long periods of time. The beer selection is pretty bland, and the most adventurous six-pack options are Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and Bell's Two Hearted Ale (which go for about $16, if I recall correctly). I've only had their food twice. The Hungry Man Burger (sautéed mushrooms, blue cheese, avocado, $8.95 for 1/2 lb.) was huge, delicious, and came with a heaping (I don't understand why people have substituted ""healthy"" for ""huge"" in other reviews...uh, opposite of healthy!) pile of fries, which were also very good. I've also had their chili cheese & sour cream fries ($6.50), which I thought were overpriced for their mediocrity--the cheese was fake and the chili was not that great (although I had tasted someone else's chili on a different visit, and it wasn't too bad then), although the portion was generous. I'll keep coming back for the low-key vibe, to eavesdrop on colorful conversations, and to support a local business. I'd just like to see a better beer selection and more enthusiasm from the bartender(s)!",3-star
"Living in the neighborhood, I really, really wanted to like this place! But that's not how things turned out, sadly. I ordered a burger, which was HUGE-- but just really not very good. It did, however, come with a nice, healthy portion of fries, which were fine! The burger didn't make me sick or anything, it just was bland tasting and actually much too big. When I tried to pick it up to take a bite, everything just fell apart in a slippery, greasy mess. My friend ordered the wings, which were actually really good! (And also came in a nice-sized portion) Like others have said, the ambiance is lacking. It is pretty bare-bones inside. They have a nice big deck out back but when we asked if we could eat outside, they said the deck was closed. (It was a beautiful July evening-- it seemed crazy not to eat outside!) I don't think I'll be back, at least not for dinner. It might not be a bad place to drop in for a drink and wings, but skip the entrees!",2-star
"I was walking around the neighborhood and decided to stop in for some lunch. It was about 3pm and there was no one in the place. The cook was sitting on a lawn chair outside and the bartender was on her cell phone. Jen, the bartender, preceded to take my order, (while still on the phone), and then left to sit outside. I watched as the cook came back in and prepared my food. The bartender came back in to wait on another customer. She hung up for him and preceded to tell the man how she was wasted and almost got arrested the night before. It seemed like every other word was included the ""F"" boom. My food arrived, steak nachos, served in a paper boat - standard pub fare. Liquid cheese from a can and a bland piece of steak cut into cubes. The only delightful part about the meal was the fresh salsa on top. I waited for 30 minutes after I finished for the bartender to give me the check. I only ordered a soda. She didn't check on me while I was eating. Since I had to leave, I got up to find her tanning herself outside. She gave me the check and walked away. The guy fixing the ice machine, watching the experience, said I should have just walked out. I have never had such bad service. The food was boring and bland. The place has the potential for being a great neighborhood pub, but they need to get their act together first.",1-star
"Stopped in here with my family post-Christmas for lunch. We had great service, good food and enjoyed the atmosphere. I'm a bit confused as to why there so many bad reviews for this place. It's a great local bar serving better than average bar food. We had a salmon Cesar salad and shared a Greek pizza served with fresh spinach on top. Both were good. We also enjoyed the seasonal Sam's Adams on tap. We'll be back!",4-star
"Living just a few blocks from this place, I really wanted to like it. And as a non-smoker, I was especially grateful for the opportunity to try out this place. Unfortunately, I was completely disappointed. The decor and lighting is jarring. I go to bars to get away from blaring TVs. How about some music? The food was ugh. Large portions does not make up for cold fries, soggy wings, etc. The food tastes like frozen, packaged factory-made food from food service companies. I don't expect bars to use all fresh-made ingredients, but a few touches of freshness would be nice.",1-star
"Great neighborhood feel. Reasonably priced. Creative and flexible chefs. We ordered the following: cheeseburger; cooked perfectly and piled high with lettuce, tomato, and onions. Came with fresh cut fries. Roasted chicken; HUGE portion of juicy, seasoned chicken served with side salad (potatoes are default) Salmon salad; nice bed of lettuce/standard salad veggies, fresh tomato vinagarette dressing, and (mediocre) salmon fillet. The fillet was a bit dry and pretty small (especially next to burger and chicken). Greek pizza sans cheese; delicious seasoned pizza dough covered with a colorful quilt of spinach, onions, sauteed mushrooms, garlic, and kalamata olives. We also ordered the mussels appetizer which was a strong 7 out of 10 in my experience of ordering mussels at a restaurant. The draft beer selection was surprisingly decent as well. FYI PARK PLACE PUB does not (as of the time of our visit) serve wine. Order a cold draft instead.",4-star
"This space was recently remodeled in effort to change from shady six-pack store to a neighborhood pub. The space looks GREAT, all but for the way-too-bright lighting which completely kills the charm of the space. Also killing the mood was the rerun of a baseball game on the TVs and complete lack of music and energy. It was midnight on a Saturday night and we WERE looking for something chill, but this was a little too chilly. I wouldn't want blasting music, but some pleasant background sounds might have earned a third star. My weak drink left much to be desired though. We did not try the food, but will try to return to do so and report back - obviously they're just getting started with this venture. Menu may be viewed on their facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Park-Place-Pub/120093864751077?sk=info. There's also talk of a patio to be opened soon on which I suggest low lighting so that one may escape the overbearing flood lights of the bar. The bar is non-smoking, which I commend. As a resident of this neighborhood, I want this place to do well. It just needs to have softer lighting, some decent vegan food items and well balanced drinks to gain my personal approval.",2-star
"I had lunch today at Pepper's Café. It's not a fancy place and the prices are very reasonable. I ordered a burger with peameal bacon (but no lettuce or onions) and fries. It was a really good burger. It seemed like it was ""homemade"" and was flavourful and hot. I'd get it again. Vania and Tyler were the servers. They were really friendly and helpful. I'll be back the next time I'm in this area.",4-star
"Oh man. This is the bargain of the summer! This little place is located just north of Bloor and Landsdowne. It has a pretty descent patio and even if it has lots of people on, it doesn't feel too crowded. The service is quite fast and very cordial. Now, the food. The range of choices is pretty vast and the quantity isn't overwhelming. Very well priced, the avg price for each item is in the ballpark of $5. The ham and cheese sandwich was tasty like the ""prego"" sandwich (pork stake in a bun). But the real winner is the chicken wings. The choice is between 12-18 and 24 pieces. Now, the whole msgs are very big but surely they are juicy and rich in flavour. They come in 4 type: mild, medium, hot and honey mustard. So, want to enjoy a pub fare for a very affordable price? Get your car and drive here. Or alternatively, you can hop off Landsdowne station and walk 5-10 mins north. Give it a try, you won't regret it! :)",4-star
"Peppers gets a five-star review for what it is: - a great neighbourhood bar. The owner is always on duty to make sure that everything is running smoothly and he is always friendly and caring. It is much favoured by local Portuguese especially from the Azores. The sports on the TV screens reflect this flavour also. The food is wholesome, basic, and inexpensive. There are only two generic beers on tap. It often has good, free, live entertainment on Thursdays. It has a fantastic open patio which is in full afternoon and evening sunlight.",5-star

"Pepper's Cafe is the ""Cheers"" of Toronto's westend. If you go there a few times, everyone will know your name. For over 30 years, this local restaurant/bar has been serving up great meals and cold drinks to it's valued customers. Joe and Judy Rodrigues(owners) will make you feel extremely comfortable with their hospitality and friendliness. The waitressing staff are equally friendly and quick on their feet. The food and drinks are served quickly(which is always a bonus). The menu is not extensive but has soups, salads, classic and Portuguese style sandwiches as well as burgers and fries. The daily specials are always made fresh and delicious. There are also desserts, coffee and an exceptionally well made espresso waiting for you. Pepper's has also been supporting local and international bands for years. Rock, Blues/Jazz and Salsa are just some of the sounds that can be heard on various Thursday/Friday nights throughout the year. The patio is relatively large and a relaxing place to have a meal with a glass of wine or just sit back and enjoy a cold beer in the sun. Pepper's Cafe is truly an gem of a spot, not only in Toronto's Westend but the entire city. Come on by and see for yourself....It's one big happy family!",5-star
"No one has Yelp'd about Peppers Cafe?! WHAT GOD WOULD LET THIS HAPPEN - HAS THE WORLD GONE TO THE DUMPS?!?! *Grabs chair and begins tying a noose * Before I hang myself - I might as well use a few of my last breaths to talk about this joint.....Let me just say that If there was a Portuguese version of Cheers this would be it..... The food is okay and they don't have a great selection of beer on tap, but what this place doesn't have in taste - makes up for it in having the most heart. The staff are friendly, owners BLEED customer service, and overall has a VERY underrated patio. I suggest stopping by before the summer is out - grab a 3 dollar draft mug and kick up a leg or two.... also when I find my fridge empty of lunch making supplies, I have no issue with going in and asking to brown bag a sandwich for me.... like mama used to do! Give this place a chance - go in with a heart and an empty stomach and leave with a filled one...... and the heart... don't forget the heart at Peppers Cafe.",4-star

"I was pleasantly surprised by this spot. It's a bar/lounge in the hotel side of the Tuscany. It's got a short bar with gaming. And then there's lots of high tops, round tables, and comfy chairs. There's a small dance floor and a small stage. It's dimly lit and almost kinda romantic. Each Friday, guest singers join the band. They play all kinds of different songs, from modern and popular to classic and rare - all with a loungified spin. I surprisingly had a good time here. They have a decent beer, wine, and cocktail list. They also have some appetizers too. The calamari was pretty decent. It's all pricier than it should be, but hey, it's Vegas. In sum, this is a bit of a hidden gem in the Tuscany hotel/casino.",4-star
"Short review GO SEE SAVANNAH AND THE MOONSHINERS ON TUESDAY NIGHTS!!! Long Review: I was searching for a fun lounge act to take my mother and sister to on their trip out to Vegas. Someone recommended the Piazza Lounge, and when I checked the website I found out about the Moonshiners which sounded awesome. We headed over at 8:30 to get a good seat, although they didn't actually start until 9. The band and lead singer are all done up in an old fashioned swing band/40's costume, which is also the style of music BUT (and here is where the awesomeness comes in) not only do they play swing classics, they do current top 40 in that swing band style. If that is your cup of tea at all, you will really love it. The singer was adorable and had a very entertaining style of singing, firstly being just plain incredible, but also adding a little cheesiness, and silliness that was a lot of fun. I really can't say enough about how much I loved them. It was so unique and entertaining, and luckily my mother and sister loved them as much as I did. Aside from the great band, the drinks were also really good. They had a menu with their specialty cocktails ($10, I think) with quirky names and very good descriptions, which I appreciate, I like to know exactly what is in something...I had something on the Pueblo, can't remember the entire name but it was a spicy tequila cocktail and it was delicious! I will definitely be back and recommend Piazza (especially Tuesday nights) to my friends. It was a ton of fun!",5-star
"This is a very nice find. It's tucked away in the Tuscany Suites. My husband and I decided to come here after having dinner at Marilynns. We love to catch some live music. The lounge itself is intimate, dim lighting with tables, bar seating and some two person high tables. All very comfortable. There's a small dance floor that quite a few great dancers took advantage of. That alone was worth watching. Wine by the glass was $7-$10 and there were some snacks available. We had some bruschetta that was tasty for $10. The server was super nice too, very fast and friendly. Now the best part was the band, Moonshiners. They are a jazz band that does a lot of recent music put to jazz arrangements, some old school jazz/swing stuff and some very cool mashups. Cab Calloway mashed with White Stripes? Awesome! Great vocals, great musicians. I will seek them out again for sure. This is a very nice venue I am sure to return to.",5-star

We thought it was a perfect off-the-strip choice for part of a romantic date night. It did not disappoint. Lots of happy people having a great time dancing, or watching the dancers.",5-star

Giannis the manager/owner was our server, and he was amazing. Fun, friendly, and recommended the single best bottle of wine we drank during a long weekend in Montreal. We shared a bunch of appetizers - spanakopita, the cold pikilia (a meze platter with various pita dipping sauce and dolmades), sausages and saganaki (flaming cheese cooked tableside). Everything was delicious. The patio in Old Montreal is spacious and has one of the best views/vibes of the city. The inside restaurant was also lovely, though we stayed on the patio for our visit. They also brought a cake with a sparkler after overhearing it was our friend's birthday. Lovely experience; highly recommended!",5-star

Great ambiance and food. Servers and staff are friendly. The restaurant hosts live performers from Greece. Overall the restaurant provides an authentic Greek cultural experience.,5-star
"The restaurant is beautiful. The staff is friendly. The chicken souvlaki is arguably the best in the city. They also have entertaining, live bouzouki on weekends. My only criticism is directed towards Montreal construction. They have to hurry up on Saint-Paul E. Every day I walk down that street and just wonder how these businesses are managing.",5-star
"Best Greek food I've had. I took the pork souvlaki, with the Ceasar salad, which had a nice Greek touch with feta cheese and home made croutons with olive oil. The spicy feta dip and the pita are definitely an amazing starter. Will definitely come back with friends and family. Everything on the menu looks amazing. My friend took the salmon and the dolmades, which was also delicious. Very good pricing for the plates we got.",5-star
"This could not have been a better lunch! Sangria was perfect for the weather, the dolmades were stunning and the Salmon was the best I've had in a very, very long time. I absolutely recomend this place.",5-star
"Not what was promised. We ordered dolmadakia (rice wrapped in vine leaves) and we asked if it's fresh, we were told its home made, as well as home made tiropites and spanakopites, truth be told it was canned dolmadakia and the same Frozen spanakopites I buy from Costco. Big disappointment. At least tell me they're not home made, don't lie to me, I'm Greek!!! Not to mention in the food business. I came to support your place, and I was lied to in my face",2-star
Nice restaurant! If you like Greek food and Greek ambiance this the place to go! The owner is very nice and they have a live music! Food was very fresh!,5-star
"Absolutely terrible service, took over 15 minutes to get asked our drink order. Food was mediocre, cheap meat and very dry. Waited for the check for over 30 minutes since we were not checked in on by our waiter but one time and the restaurant was not busy. Will not be coming back.",1-star
"The food is great Pittsburgh food. The atmosphere typical sports bar, so that's cool. The bartender Jessica needs to go, she was absolutely the rudest bartender in town. She rolled her eyes because I changed my mind. If she is ever at he bar again when I come in I'll leave.",3-star
"I was excited to try the Pittsburgh staple for the first time but ended up being disappointed. The fries in my sandwich were cold and soggy. They clearly were not freshly prepared. I got the pastrami and it's not really top notch deli quality. It could have used mustard, too. Still I'm happy I got a chance to try, and the service was good!",3-star
"Had the Nachos and one of their feature beers, all good. Enjoyed our waitress banter, a fun place to grab a snack after watching the Colonials game at the Island. You certainly need to navigate the menu for choice items, but this snack worked out for us. Enjoy",4-star
"We've been here many times since this location opened. It's one of those things that you don't review unless it's one extreme or another. Tonight was the final bad experience. We were seated and waited 15 minutes before our waitress came by. A food runner tried to give us another order and I told him we've never seen a waitress. Mysteriously she finally shows up to take our drink order. 8 minutes later I finally had a beer in my hand and shortly after we ordered. We ordered a pizza, couple salads and a smallman St fry. The salads we're okay, but pizza and fries were completely inedible. Fries were cold, and a blob of grease (more than normal). The pizza dough was half cooked, paper flat, and wet. Took close to another 15 minutes to find our waitress to complain too. The ""manager"" stopped by and told us he'd take them off the check. I told him this wasn't our first bad experience. I expected the salads to get comped too. Nope. Still left with a $40 check that half of our party didn't eat. I explained my upset to our waitress. To which she replied, yeah we get busy and things go down hill. But it wasn't busy. There was no wait for a table. Guess when I'm craving Primantis, we'll have to sick to the Crafton location. The crew of this Moon location cost themselves a long time customer in us.",1-star
"Dinner Dec 7 Service was incredible. Atmosphere was ""my kinda place"" except for all the Steelers stuff, but hey, I was in Pittsburgh. Got the #2 best seller -- the #1 best seller you ask - BEER. This sandwich was a monster. And at $7.99 a very very reasonably priced entree. I heard tell Pittsburgians drink and can eat two of these things! SALUTE, cuz my fat arse couldn't finish 1 ! My only compliant/comment on the #2 was it needed a sauce of some sort or maybe ketchup/mayo - which I will do next time! Got the Retro Tots - loved them, but loved that house made dipping sauce EVEN more. Upon further discussion, learned some of the Primanti insiders put that retro tot sauce on their sandwiches - great idea. Wings were very small and priced accordingly - but sauces were way above average.",4-star
"Maybe it was the san which that i ordered, it just was not good at all. I ordered their pitt sandwich and i was disappointed. The patty used was dry and almost meatloaf in tasted and flavor. I kept using different sauces they had to make it taste better but i just could not finish the sandwich. I appreciate the service and the huge selection of beers though.",2-star
"We came here on a work trip, expecting a typical sports bar. Our waiter Matthew went through the menu with us and was terrific! We got a couple sandwiches with the intent to split. I guess it was a little more complicated so the manager came over to figure out exactly what we wanted! Above and beyond service that is rare to come by these days!! Terrific place and service!",5-star
"I have always stayed at La Quinta while in Pittsburgh, and it's so nice to have Primanti Brothers within a short walking distance (and no highway to cross)! Food is fantastic, great prices on both food and happy hour drinks, and you can get beer to go if you want to relax in your hotel room. If only they had a smoking section but I understand the local laws. Great ambiance, wonderful staff! I'll be back!",4-star
"We heard that a trip to Pittsburgh wasn't complete without a visit to Primanti Brothers so we found this location in Moon on the way to the airport. Our server was really great and talked us through the menu since it was our first visit. He was patient and kind and explained a lot. The food was good. I had the tater tots with bacon, cheese, and ranch dressing and they were delicious. Shared a piece of pizza, ours was not very well done but the guy next to us had a piece that looked amazing. The chili was good, obviously made fresh, crunchy onions, a touch of sweetness. This location is very close to a military base and when we were there the place was filled with men and women in uniform... support our troops in any way you can and if you have the opportunity and the ability, contribute towards their meal! They deserve to know that they have our support. **==",4-star
This place is dirty. Sat in the bar area and it had a weird smell like stagnant water or something. Food was good as ever and service was good. But this place needs a good scrub down!,2-star
Expected More The food was good but for being famous I was expecting out of this world. It was good but nothing really spectacular.,4-star
"Who doesn't love primantis?!!! A place where the French fries, ranch dressing, and beer never stop coming! It's a friendly atmosphere and if you aren't from the burgh the staff and patrons will make you feel welcome. Get the steak salad, but be forewarned this isn't going to fall in your paleo/no carb/low fat diet. It's totally worth it tho!",5-star
"I am a fan of the Almost Famous Primanti Bros sandwiches. Every Time I come to Pittsburgh, I need to have one. Today our wait staff was Michael, he was great and helpful.",5-star
"I've been here a few times and each experience is so-so. The first time everything was amazing. The second time I had won a gift card so my boyfriend and I went and everything was dry. When we went the third time, my boyfriend and I, we only order appetizers. That was better than before. The servers don't really give you much attention. We went as a group of 6 to drink and eat. It was so difficult to get drinks. Our server went and sat down 3 tables away to eat while we were trying to order more drinks and food. We sat there for 20 minutes until he came back to ask if we wanted more drinks. He was taking forever to grab beers and bring them to us, 20 minutes, and we were some of the only people there. The server, Corey, messed up all of our checks several times. After five tries he finally got things right. We were furious about the lack of serves that we left him with $1 tip between everyone. I hate not tipping 20% but if I'm going to be ignored or watch you eat and drink while we have nothing I'm going to tip in reflection to my serves.",1-star
For years my friends from Pittsburgh have raved about this place and I had to try it out. I wasn't disappointed and it has become one of my favorite sandwiches in the country. I can't wait to be in the area again so I can delight my tastebuds again.,4-star
"I need to not be so critical. Everybody has a bad night or two. The sandwiches are great, beer cold and the service is good. How can you not like a place that has a balloon animal station for the kids during dinner time?",4-star
I have the steak sandwich when I wind up there. service can be spotty at times depending on how busy they are. over all not bad.,4-star
"Great food. Had a minor issue, but the manager on duty, shawn, helped us and everything was excellent. Definitely be back because of him.",5-star
"Good solid bread, pretty well cooked meat, cheese, fries and coleslaw! That pretty much sums up the experience. Taste was very good and the quantity was amazing. The only reason I took off a star is I found it dry! A sort of gravy or anything would have made it earn a star more. After a few bites it kind of felt sticking in the throat. Except that everyone on the table enjoyed the meal. A memorable one indeed. Primanti in a way defines pittsburgh. Its all well and good but somewhere it lacks something that we arent able to identify. Cheers!",4-star
"I brought 80 high school kids to this location on a SATURDAY, and I was floored at how prepared they were for us. Large ensemble directors, this is your place. The organization was impeccable, and I just can't thank Hagen, Sean, and their talented team for giving us such a wonderful experience.",5-star
Great food and atmosphere. Nice bar area and family dining area. Plenty of television for sports viewing and entertainment.,5-star
"Fairly bland sandwich, very weak drinks. They no longer sell their famous Pittsburgher with roast beef, ham and turkey that made them famous. I had to order that special. And I ordered a rum drink. It had no rum in it at all that I could tell. I tasted no rum in it so I assume that it had none. I asked the waitress about it and she told me that Primanti's is not known for their mixed drinks but it is for their sandwiches and beer. Maybe that's why. It was an expensive fruit drink. The service though was superb.",3-star
"Primanti Brothers is an institution. There is absolutely no argument from me there. I've seen them on Man vs Food, other Travel Channel types of food shows, etc. It's a very well known place and I was looking forward to going there. This is not their ""main"" location but it was the most convenient location to where I was staying in Pittsburgh. I've had other types of ""overstuffed"" sandwiches before and I've always seemed to enjoy them. I arrived and it's set up pretty much like any other chain type of restaurant (i.e. hostess stand when you walk in, dining room to your right, and bar/additional dining area to your left). I grabbed a booth and was happy to see they had TV's everywhere. It's definitely a sports themed type of place. This would definitely be a good place to catch a game. They have phenomenal happy hour prices throughout the week and seem to have a different special just about every day of the week. I knew I was getting a sandwich but I wasn't sure which one I was going with. I debated between the Roast Beef and cheese and the pastrami and cheese. Then, the waitress came over and told me a lot of people had been ordering the ""When Pigs Fly"" sandwich which was a new one. It was turkey, ham and bacon complete with all the other fixings. I didn't read on the menu that it also contained a fried egg. I'm not a fan of fried eggs on lunch or dinner types of sandwiches, like a burger, for example. I decided to go with the When Pigs Fly. Major props to Primanti's because the sandwich was served quickly. It's two thick slices of bread, the turkey, ham, bacon, tomato, cole slaw and french fries...and the fried egg. Again, I was not a huge fan of the fried egg on the sandwich. The sandwich also needed some type of dressing or sauce as it was a little on the drier side. I decided to use some ketchup at the end. I liked the sandwich but it was not life changing. As an FYI, there's not a ton of meat. There's a lot of fillers but I did particularly like the cole slaw. It was more lettuce as it was not mayo based. It was a vinegar based cole slaw which was cool. I also liked the french fries that came on the sandwich. Overall, I definitely liked the sandwich and it was pretty reasonably priced at about $9 or so. If you're in Pittsburgh, I think you need to come here for the experience. Service was fast and friendly throughout.",3-star
"We don't have a Primanti Brothers where I'm from so, while visiting Pittsburgh, I had to swing by and have a sandwich. I can only say that it was surprisingly fantastic. One wouldn't expect a sandwich of fries, beef and coleslaw to be tasty, but in fact it was. A hearty sandwich and a couple cold beers were perfect for this blustery, winter day.",4-star
nothing to write home about. nothing really had any taste. not enough seasoning or cheese on their sandwiches. lots of us tried different sandwiches and really none of us thought they were anything special. maybe just go to the original location. glorified applebees,2-star
Decent food and great service. I am from out of town and the bartenders were the most beautiful women I saw in Pittsburgh. Totally worth it!,4-star
"Pretty sub-par. The spicy battered pickles were thin slivers and not spicy. Bummer. My ranch fries were pretty good but don't let them fool you into believe this stuff is freshly cut. All of my friends had their Pitts-burger and most didn't finish because it was so poorly done. Oh, well. Don't plan on going back.",2-star
"Before I begin my account of last weekend's double date lunch at this Primanti's, I must first address some of the snarkier (obnoxious? rude? insincere? worthy of a boot to the head?) reviews. #1-The place was not dirty. Those who say it was either came on a bad night or are attempting to libel a city through one of its institutions for whatever warped reasons they have floating around in their malformed brains. #2-The staff was not rude, socially backward, or any such thing. I had zero caveats about the service. Our waiter was attentive, clean-cut, spot-on, and unintrusive. See #1 for the rest. My God, do you people hate our city that much? High school is over. You are no longer in 10th grade. Move on. #3-I had no problem with the paper cups. I don't know why one would not expect paper cups from an eatery such as this. #4-We were given real silverware. #5-Who in the frack orders sparkling water at a Primanti's restaurant only to slag them for not having it? Having ranted sufficiently, this very suburban Primanti's is for people who find the original Strip District locale to be a little too raw for their timid souls; the self-titled Metallica album vs. Kill 'Em All. This is a case of the Bob Rock figure coming to the Primanti's people and telling them they need to be a little more like Applebee's. Now having said all of THAT, I was shocked at the amount of choices this Primanti's offers and at how relatively tranquil it was. There were even video games! How's that for family friendly? This Primanti's has pizza, pierogi, 8 different salads, fried pickles, stuffed pretzels, jalapeno poppers, nachos, wings, a gyro, 5 Crostini sandwiches, Chicken Al Fredo (!), Sausage Al Forno (uhhh what?) a burger (I almost ordered one just to see how they do a burger but was thwarted by my companions), and (I'm not jaggin' ze wires) dessert! More on the sweets later. No, I would go Black like Venom and Angus like Mr. Young of AC/DC, eschewing the Italian and Kosher meats for the marinated supremacy of The Black Angus Sirloin Steak Sandwich. I picked up one half of it and noticed that the meat and cut french fries made it look as if it was an angry, sneering, overconfident mob boss with a mouthful of cigars being confronted by the Punisher towards the end of a long story arc. ""What? You wanna play hero, huh? You think yer gonna stop me ya do-gooder sonovabitch?"" My imagination had nearly come unglued. The heat from the sandwich burned my fingers, causing me to drop it. The egg I ordered on it spilled out as if it was a tongue, taunting me like many a rough trade sandwich. That's when I realized something: You can take a Primanti's off the street and into the suburbs, but you can't take the street OUT of a Primanti's sandwich! It is a rumbler no matter where it is made, and B.A.S.S.S is certainly one of the baddest bad-ass sandwiches ever prepared. One a hell of an alleyway brawl, the Italian bread damn near disintegrated, frustrating me. I flipped it over several times to gain leverage, but once I did and tasted THOSE fries mingling with THAT chilled, sauerkraut-ish cole slaw, and the most seared and searing steak ever, I was suddenly a laborer on a truck in Pittsburgh during the Great Depression, grime on my face, one hand on the steering wheel, the other hand holding an entire meal between two bread slices. There's a reason for the renown, even if not every one ""gets"" it because it's not expensive or gourmet or New York or L.A. enough for them. It is a serious sandwich, one that could put Au Bon Pain out of commission forever if it felt like it. This alone was more than enough...but wait! They have chili too? Oh yes they do, and it's quite strong, not only in terms of quality but in terms of spice as well. *cough cough* Christ, it kicked like a mule, man, the cheese not cutting the heat a whole lot, the raw diced onion only aggravating matters. It's a soupy chili that has plenty of beans but isn't overrun with them for the purposes of being a filler, the amount of ground meat proving ample. Give this to me on a bitter winter day and watch me plow through 2 feet of snow afterwards. Primanti's chili is evidence that the chain has a bag of tricks apart from their famous sandwiches. Dessert was decent but quite obviously pre-fabricated. Kay's brother and his New York girlfriend (she LOVED the place by the way) ordered a brownie sundae that looked frozen then thawed via microwave magic (the ProTools of cooking), our pecan pie cut tasting like it. Is it that hard to bake your own pies and brownies? You've only got two desserts on your menu! For that I deduct a star. The urbanite in me wanted to dock them another for the feeling that something unnameable is missing. Perhaps its the idea of having a Primanti's in Moon Township. Contrived? Accessible. Ah, that's the word. Hey, if it acts as a calling-card, so be it. P.S. The NRA boycotted them. Bonus!",4-star
"It's one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh! There is a big menu to choose from. Even though Primanti sandwiches are not the healthiest, there are healthier foods to choose from. FOOD: I always choose their fish sandwich(not the colossal one). Now if you're not familiar with Primanti's sandwiches, think about a sandwich using sliced Italian bread, with french fries, and coleslaw on top of the fried fish. The french fries are like boardwalk fries that are a bit soggy, and the coleslaw is vinegar based and sweet. It may not sound appetizing, but it's delicious! It's also a huge sandwich, so you may not be a pretty sight when eating a Primanti's sandwich. With your sandwich you can also get a slice of pizza for $1. You can't beat that! They're open late, so get Primanti's sandwich after a night of drinking!",5-star

"Worst restaurant experience of my adult life! Valentines Day, I know, i know, can't judge a restaurant on Valentines Day, whatever, it was awful and I didn't even get to order. Ok, reso's made a month in advance, no mention of an abbreviated menu due to Valentines Day, one reason we chose Primo. We arrive and the maitre d/bartender/tennis pro doesn't say ""hello"", ""welcome"", ""Happy Valentines Day"" nope none of that just a rude ""name"". I give our name he immediately turns and walks away, my wife and I look at each other in wonder, he pops his head around the corner annoyed and gestures with his hand for us to come. He takes us to a rickety folding table crammed against the wall, I can barely fit in my seat, no menus and walks off without a word. Ugh. About 10 minutes later a waiter shows "" can I start you off with cocktails?"" Sure can we see a cocktail menu, 10 minutes later he arrives with the wine list drops it off keeps walking, I flag him down 5 minutes after being ignored and he comes over and says ""have you decided on a cocktail yet"" I inform him we still have no cocktail menu and we have been waiting a while with no water or food menus. Without a word he hands us two dirty some what wrinkled pieces of paper...the abbreviated menu. 5-6 items to choose from, nothing Italian and all price gouged. Again he walks away. I am losing my mind, my wife sees how visibly upset I am tries to calm me, we debate leaving but where are we gonna go on Valentines Day at 8 pm without reservations? 25 minutes at a cramped table with no menus, no water, no cocktails and no patience. We agree to leave rather continue to ruin our evening. I tell the waiter we cannot take this anymore and are out, his response...OK, can you believe that, ""ok""? Rude, crappy folding table, crappy menu, crappy service awful experience! Saving grace, downstairs Zio was able to accommodate us and turned a miserable night into a good night with my wife Check out my review of Zio's to hear their praises Heed my warning, stay away from Primo's",1-star

"Not sure how this place is still around. I too went on a Saturday night and there was no one else in the restaurant. My friends had gift certificates which is why I ended up here. The food is generic Italian, nothing special, the type of food you find in a tourist style restaurant in Little Italy. The table ordered calamari to start. Smallest calamari I have ever seen in my life. I joked with my friends that they must be organic. I had the stuffed chicken entree. The chicken was super bland and the sundried tomato filling looked like a paste from a can. It didn't taste good either. I did order a bottle of red wine (super Tuscan) that was pretty decent. It was slightly over $200 for 4 people... For a good dinner I don't mind spending $50 but was definitely not worth it at this place. There must be better Italian in Charlotte.",2-star
"What can I say other than this place just plain stinks. I usually do not give 1 star ratings but this place had it coming. We went there with friends for dinner and there were several issues. First of all the waitstaff were very snooty and unfriendly. I got the vibe this place was big for the local Myers Park crowd and the whole atmosphere smelled of rich arrogance, so I was a little put off from the start. Secondly, they need to learn how to cook Filet, Both myself and my buddy ordered the Filet, I ordered it medium rare and he ordered it well. The steaks came out cooked identical, both were cooked well done. For a place that seems so arrogant they need to work on their skills in the kitchen to back up the attitude. The third and final insult came with the french waiter there dropped a knife not only once but three times on my wife, all without apologizing. I was beginning to think they were trying to tell us to leave. Save your money, you can get a better steak at Longhorn without paying a premium.",1-star
"We were looking forward to going to this new restaurant. But the experience was less than ideal. I ordered the stuffed chicken which sounded delectable and really flavorful. But what I got was overcooked,dry chicken and very bland stuffing. My friend got the salmon, and she really enjoyed her meal. So she probably would give a different rating for this restaurant. But I won't be going back.",2-star
"Primo...Hmmmm the word means ""Male Cousin""..odd name for a restaurant. It is hidden away off Providence Rd..behind Boston Market...Upstairs..in a crooked floored second story. The restaurant was empty, we were pretty early at 5:30 PM but we were sat on a cold porch, in the very back of the room at a tiny - tiny two top table. The bus boy brought us water and a basket with unimpressive cold bread and butter. Never had heard much about Primo and it was Queens Feast so my daughter and I thought we would give it a try. We ordered a bottle of wine from Lodi, it was good, called Brazin a Zinfandel. My daughter and I decided to each try a different appetizer. She had the Shrimp St Thomas, it was 4 small shrimp on a plate with a very plain white mustard sauce. I ordered the Portebello Mushroom that had mozzarella and truffle oil..Mine was better than my daughters but still nothing impressive. We both ordered the Chopped Salad...not bad till I had to pull the long hair attached to a piece of blue cheese out of my mouth...done with the salad...We both ordered the Ribeye, odd choice for an Italian place but not too much Italian except Lobster Ravioli. The plate arrived and the meat looked attractive, the ICE CREAM SCOOP of Mashed Potatoes was not, however. My daughter took her first bite and pulled out a piece of metal wire..about 1/2 inch long. We told the waitress and she took it back to show the manager. The steak's flavor was good but the meat was not prime..mine was tough, and it was done rare plus so it should have been more tender. We did not eat any more of the mashed potatoes and they were not fresh, either frozen or boxed, and we were scared of finding more metal. The waitress brought our check, I asked her if the manager was going to come and talk with us about the metal and she said the manager was the owner and the chef all rolled into one..and he was very busy. Hmmmm too busy for a customer who got metal in their mashed potatoes??? Maybe he should have sent the ""Male Cousin"" over ! Glad this was just a 30.00 check for each of us..Not worth the 30...even.",1-star
"I know it is restaurant week and a Wednesday on top of that, but we decided to head out and give this place a try since there were two good reviews. SKIP this place and head uptown or Piedmont Row. I am not sure who our server was but he had zero interest in making the evening pleasant. He went through the motions and in one case tossed our steak knives on the plates and walked away. The food was better than average and the Super Tuscan wine was very good. We decided to order desserts after dinner and they came straight from the fridge to our table. I was hoping to find a gem in this place.",2-star
"We stopped at the bar for a drink after going to Boston Market & were pleasantly surprised to find it a beautiful Italian restaurant! We made reservations for dinner on another night through Open Table. We stopped in at the bar before our table was ready & Christine was very helpful & charming to talk to. The restaurant itself is traditionally decorated with big, softly colored murals & appropriately dim lighting. Every seat seems to be a good one. Although there are some tables along the front window, you don't get to take in the beautiful restaurant (& people) This is definitely a dress-up restaurant! Sedate & beautiful dresses on the ladies (no slacks!) & sports coats on the gents. A soft bread & large, tasty crackers came first. We started dinner with a bottle of the Caposaldo Prosecco, which we enjoyed while waiting for our appetizers of the Onion Soup & Escargot. They were both delicious. Sweetie got the Angel Hair Pasta with shrimp, basil & garlic Aglio Olio. It was yummy. I got the crab cakes & they were mostly lump crabmeat with barely anything holding it together which is the way I like them. A good aioli came with it and a small side of fresh veggies. They were the best crabcakes I've had in Charlotte so far. Our waiter was mostly efficient, & we didn't have to wait for anything & he kept checking on us. I think his name was Noor. The menu itself has a good selection of traditional Italian items & we would go again! Mangia, Charlotte!",4-star
"Will never go again. Went based off a review about this restaurant that really hyped out this place. What a let down due to the food. You can tell that this is a OLD restaurant with a very OLD clientele who are use to the OLD way of doing things. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a strong believer of 'if ain't broke, don't fix it.' But I could totally see this place featured on FOX Kitchen Nightmares. Lets focus on the good: Great service, speedy food service and great wine list. The bad: Old furniture, plates, glasses, decor and horrible paint job. Made me not want to eat, I was worried that I might catch something. Lastly, the driest chicken, and steak me and my date ever had.",1-star
"Wow, I was so unimpressed. We chose Primo for our Anniversary and to experience their Restaurant Week menu. We arrived for our reservation, were greeted and promptly seated. We then waited, waited, and after about 5 minutes (sorry timed it) we were greeted by the server. The restaurant was not full and I feel there was no excuse for the delay. Once greeted we ordered a cocktail and were briefed on the menu. Little did we know my mother-in-law visited the restaurant personally that day and purchased us a glass of champagne to celebrate our anniversary. NEVER RECEIVED THE CHAMPAGNE. The food arrived and was just OK. The appetizers were nothing special, the salad was just ok, and the entrée while the veal and steak were good the risotto with the veal was not a good compliment. Restaurant Week is designed to showcase your restaurant so others will want to return. I can't trust the food or service will be any better when they are not showcasing than when they are.",1-star

"****Bar review only**** My husband and I were in town for Thanksgiving and met a friend of mine and her boyfriend here (their choice) for after dinner drinks. It was not crowded at all around 8:30pm on the day after Turkey Day. The special was $3 captains but all of us went for beer instead. I like the craft variety as opposed to the usual suspects at places like this-Miller lite, bud light, coors light, Yuengling-and there were a couple of options. The first bartender was pretty terrible and couldn't list the IPAs they had (after telling me they had 2), went over to check them and reported back to me, and then came back and said she read them wrong and wanted to make sure I still wanted one of them but still could only tell me the brewery they were from and not the full name. Odd. The later bartender at least kept the glass full when I wanted another one. So Friday night is karaoke and it was......well, hopefully no one that did it actually thinks they have a future on The Voice. The song choices were pretty terrible too ranging from country to Christmas songs. I would not have chosen to come here on my own but I am glad my friend chose here because it's a non-smoking bar (Yep, in PA they still have bars you can smoke in) so there's that. Maybe their food is better......",2-star

"Had Gene Marie in catering cater a party for my family a couple of weeks ago and went to pick it up day of and she insisted we canceled the order...nothing was ready they had to make everything from scratch and the food was HOURS late. She kept blaming it on my family and being super rude, after we had text messages to confirm that she said food would be ready for the date and time we had scheduled. It was absolutely horrible she was so rude and will NOT be planning any more catering orders through her from that party on. DO NOT RECOMMEND. If I could give 0 stars I would.",1-star
"Hadn't gone there in a long time, too hot to cook so decided on pizza. Called in our order, nothing hard, medium cheese pizza, 4 slice Sicilian and there Roma puffs. Had to wait for my order even though I got there when they said it would be ready, the take out pick up area reeks of cigarette smoke. I could hardly breathe. Everything was hot when I brought it home. The pizza was ok, nothing special, the Sicilian was over cooked, burnt on the edges and the biggest disappointment was the puffs. Someone forget to put the cheese on them so it was just fried dough with watery sauce. Very disappointed. It must have been a slow night because 3 waitresses were sitting outside having a loud conversation and cursing for the customers.",2-star
"The FOOD is wonderful. The woman who works the take-out/catering counter? Unbelievable. Watched her cuss out a customer in front of me, then tried to get into it with me. I had my proof of purchase, I just wanted to pick up the food for my brother's engagement party. I was in there ten minutes longer than necessary because she kept attempting to start an argument about ""WPXI coupons"". I'll skip the drama and get my next party catered somewhere where I'm treated with kindness and respect.",1-star

Great pizza! Has a traditional Italian pizza shop taste. Also really good Italian and steak hoagies. One of the best in the area. Would always recommend. If you are in the mood for a salad try the Romano crusted chicken salad and you won't want to have another salad ever again.,5-star
My friend and I decided to meet for lunch but we had limited time available and we were not quite sure where to go so we ventured onto Perry Highway and decided to try out Roma because we saw they had outdoor seating . After looking at the menu we were told they also offer a lunch buffet inside the dining area so we opted to have the buffet This was a perfect choice because we were able to try out various menu selections and it saved us the right amount of time to eat . We were told that the entrée choices change day to day. The restaurant has a huge dining room and a very large bar with an open patio. It looks like the perfect spot to be on game night.,4-star
The absolute worst delivery service I have ever experienced. Time and time again they forget items and are terribly rude on the phone. Have tried to be understanding but will never order from here again. Also the bar atmosphere is extremely uncomfortable and unwelcoming.,1-star
Prices aren't bad. Place is nice. Ordered the roma puffs. They were ok but on the dry side. Also ordered the Roma pizza with everything except hot peppers and anchovies. This pizza was very good. I would definitely come back here for the pizza.,4-star
When they don't have enough menus for the table (4 people) it should've been a sign the experience wouldn't be good. Service wasn't to great and it took almost 40 minutes for our food. Pizza was average with nothing to pull me back. If you have a choice between Roma and another place go to the other place.,2-star
"I have stopped by here twice for lunch with my father in the past couple of months with the most recent time a few Tuesdays ago. The inside of the restaurant here is pretty dim, especially as soon as you walk in but it gets brighter the closer you get towards the windows which surround about half of the seating areas. There seems to be two distinct seating areas in here with both having a number of tables and booths. During the lunch hours there is also a buffet set in the foyer type area. Both times that I have gone with my father we have ordered the buffet and each time the items on it were different. However the general setup was similar with there being one entree, one starch, one vegetable, one soup, some salad and different pizzas coming out. The soup was wedding soup both times but the entree this last time was stuffed peppers while the previous time it was chicken parmesan, the vegetable this last time was green beans while the previous time it was greens and beans and the starch this time was some scalloped potatoes and I dont remember what it was the previous time. While none of these items blew me away, they were all pretty solid and I enjoyed trying each of them. My favorite part of the buffet has to be the pizza though. While the restaurant itself was slow getting out new pizzas (they do two at a time with multiple toppings on each), the pizza itself is easily some of the better pizza in the North Hills. Yes it is greasy but it also has the perfect ratio of cheese/sauce and crust for me with the outer crust have a nice crisp to it. The bottom line for me is that I will be back here again in the future. While the food itself may only be 4 star worthy, I really enjoy this buffet and the value of the place easily makes it worth 5 stars.",5-star
The food was good and the prices reasonable . The service and decor were comfortable . This is a nice local place to go for a good filling Italian meal . They have a large and comfortable bar lounge and even a small outdoor seating area . Try it ..you'll like it !,4-star
"Arrived without reservation on a beautiful if slightly cool early June night. Patios full.... Calgarians are s hearty bunch. No table available but the hostess found me a seat at the bar. She updated staid a couple of times so that I knew she hadn't forgotten me... and as a walk-in single I had low expectations given that the place was full. Two glasses of chianti at the bar and then transported to a booth... more than I needed to eat but perfect to review stuff for tomorrow's conference. Service was friendly and effective, My server was professional and efficient and the steak and salad showed up in jig's time. The new york striploin was perfectly done. Turned down the baked potato because I would have eaten it and the substituted house salad was perfect. Great experience on a business trip. Great customer experience.",4-star
"In Calgary for the day. Wanted something convenient to Le Germain hotel to treat my daughter to. Saltlik hit it out of the Park. Cozy atmosphere sitting in a booth in front of the fireplace on an unseasonably cold Calgary night. The food was excellent. Steak was delicious, ribs tasty and fall off the bone and the hunter chicken looked good. Over and above the quality of the food was the service from the hostess to the staff busing the table to the waiter ""Ali"". We spent the night commenting on how attentive the staff were. Memorable evening thanks!",5-star
Coming back here just for the wok fried calamari .. beats every calamari I ever tasted ...it's a must have when u r in Calgary .. sorry I ate it all up before clicking a decent picture,5-star
Right away we noticed that the service here was a little slow and it took quite a while for them to actually take out orders. With that being said the steak was cooked perfectly and the sides were generous sized portions as well. Our server was pretty nice and I highly recommend the duck fat fires and their steaks,4-star
"First off, this place isn't a steak house, and if others tell you that it is, either they don't know what a steak house is or have limited experience eating steak in restaurants. I ordered the expensive lunch special which was a steak sandwich coming in at a $27 price point. It was not worth the price paid for the meal, based on quantity and quality, you can get a much better steak in Calgary, trust me! The service was very good though, and a pretty good atmosphere in the restaurant.",3-star
We will be back! Read some reviews that almost made us not try this place. Our Waiter Tyler was awesome as well as the other staff that checked in frequently to see if we needed anything..great steaks and lobster mashed potatoes!,4-star
"Been to Saltlik multiple time in the past. Have always gotten the Filet (which is fantastic by the way), but wanted to get something different this time just to mix it up. Tried two appies, popcorn chicken (not bad, has popcorn on the bottom) and the dried ribs (not really dried, glazed with a sauce, VERY good and would definitely get again). Decided to get the Michaelangelo Chicken Penne. Not too bad, sauce is a bit on the salty/oily side, but had some good flavour. Pasta was the right texture and the Chicken was cooked well. If I were to come back, I wouldn't get it again. I'll stick to the Filet or the Ribs with Lobster Mash.",4-star
"One word, amazing! We went to Saltlik for the first time last nite, what a beautiful restaurant! Definitely impressed. Our server James was great, very friendly, and down to earth, all while still being professional. We had the popcorn shrimp, soooooo good. Lobster mashed potatoes are a definite must have.... I'm drooling just thinking about them. Both of our steaks were cooked perfectly, great portions. Dessert was a chocolate ganache cake, save room! It is kind of pricey, I guess some people would think that? But well worth it. Not to mention they played some awesome music, a mix of everything from Guns'n'Roses to The Killers. It was a perfect way to spend our anniversary, and I would recommend going there to anyone!",5-star
"I am not a huge steak connoisseur. For some reason, it is just hard for me to be impressed with a grilled slab of meat. However, there were a few times in my life when I was really wowed by the flavour and texture of steak, and it is those fond memories that drive me to visit a steakhouse once in a blue moon. Plus, being in Calgary, I decided it was finally time to try that famed Alberta beef. Saltlik seemed like a natural choice - smack in the middle of downtown, with a cool name and a fancy-looking huge glass door that separates the chosen few on the inside from the plebes wandering the 8th Avenue. And I am only half kidding - as I understand, a steak restaurant is a special occasion kind of a place, where you splurge but expect elite food and elite service. Saltlik, on the other hand, is very down to earth. Too much so, actually. The tiny lobby was being cleaned as I walked in, as if the restaurant was closing. The staff, while very friendly, is not really best educated on the wine and food choices. The first surprise came when I found out there was no bread (!) in the restaurant - only garlic bread, which, naturally, is not free. That was a first one for me. The house salad is less than impressive - bitter salads, a couple of cut strawberries and a tiny bit of goat cheese. No tomatoes or other vegetables. But OK, that was just a snack before the big steak dinner. I waited, and waited, and then more. Finally, the meat came. What can I say? It was another night of disappointment in my quest for a perfect steak. It was dry-ish and rather tough, despite my lengthy requests for something tender and marbled when ordering. So, that's about it for Saltlik. I am afraid it's another case of a restaurant trying to be something it isn't, which is all too common in Calgary, alas.",2-star
Excellent food and service. what's more can you ask from a restaurant. I got the beef carpaccio for appetizer and the filet mignon for main course. Everything was delicious.,4-star

"First of all, this was our very first time here. After purchasing 4 drinks and 2 big breakfast, we moved from our table to the lounge chair area to play jenga. There was no RSVP signs for the area, but we were rudely asked SEVERAL times whether we would order food or drinks. And they all had an attitude. It was either us ordering or basically we had to leave. I didn't know we could NOT stay around and drink and hang out? To even be more terrible, we were the ONLY black and asian couple at the restaurant. Mind you we are very financially well off, and our clothes and appearance should speak for itself. I was really upset by the passive aggressive treatments we received from THREE different waitresses, who kept checking on us to see when we would leave. We were only at the restaurant for an hour too. The one star I left was for our actual waitress, she was sweet and polite.",1-star
"This place is perfect if you love the view of the lake, delicious food, drinks and watching boats come in and out. Very relaxing, great menu options, the flat breads are delicious. Breakfast is awesome but I wish it was at least till noon for weekend lazy birds like me. This is my new fav local place",4-star
"Have to say I had high hopes for this place. Went in on a Saturday afternoon with some friends for lunch. The service was the worst the appetizers came out before the drinks. The manager said they were busy. Thought of the day, help. Food and drinks were expensive and low quality. This place is not a do over for our group.",1-star
"Giving 2 stars because I have been here before and food is good. But today, at 230 on a Monday we went for a late lunch, pay the $6 entry fee and make our way to the dock. Walk in, empty tables every where, but looked fairly crowded on the patio was told it would be a 45min wait?! What the what?! Since the food is good but not stellar, we walked, not going to wait. 45 min for bar food. Hope they get it together because it's a peaceful spot",2-star
"I've been here 4 times, service is ALWAYS slow. Yesterday we waited 30 minutes for a table, no problem. 3 ladies at entrance, one seating patrons other 2 folding napkins. All 3 RUDE. When you'd attempt to ask a question they'd turn and walk away. Waitress took our order, waited 35 minutes for water, meal arrived 15 minutes later. I consider myself a rather patient person, but I DO NOT like being ignored when I ask a simple question, I won't be back. I wanted to leave after a half hour but was overruled. Food was average, nothing to write home. Price was high, 12 to 16 bucks for burger type food. Well I wish you the best, because folks will read this and go anyway. Yes I'm one of those. Good luck",1-star
Scorpion Bay has great food while still being super affordable given the location. The wait time for food seems a bit long even on days when the lake is not busy at all but you can't really complain since it's extremely convenient.,4-star
"If you love eating great food on a beautiful lake in Arizona this is the place to go. There is a beautiful scenic drive up and a fun tram down to the Grill and the marina.

A relaxing and lively place to eat.",4-star
Want expecting such good food at a marina! Salmon stuffed scallops over kale were delightful! Surprised!! Good beer and service too.,5-star
"Awesome atmoshere, only real gripe was had to pay 6 dollars to enter county park where place is located. Food was good, not great, prices as expected. Could use a better selection of malt beverages, no mikes, no smirnoff ice, no hard root beer, nothing except angry orchard. Sit on the dock if the weather is nice. Long walk from parking area, fairly steep stairs to dock, equally steep going UP after dinner. They do have 2 very slow trams if working. Nice place to bring a date or significant other.",3-star
What a great change of pace! Service from both servers was excellent. Very pleased with our food. My husband had a turkey burger while I had the Sonoran chicken salad. The best part was the view! Do not sit inside if the weather is nice! Eating while surrounded by the gorgeous Lake Pleasant was exactly what my husband and I needed for a relaxing day off!,5-star
"Wow! Loved this place. Came here a couple times when it was still Dillons... but never really liked it. After Dillons left they became Scorpion Bay Grill and remodeled. It was fantastic. The service was perfect and the food was great. We had potato skins which were some of the best we've ever had anywhere and also had a Buffalo Chicken sandwhich and Turkey Burger. Both were perfectly cooked, large portions and the fries that came with the burger were unique and amazing. They had the perfect amount of crunch and softness inside. I absolutely dig the new look outside and will certainly start coming back more often!! I highly recommend this place if you want to have a great lunch while floating on Lake Pleasant.. this is your place!",5-star
"A lovely 105 degree day at the Marina with no AC and fans spinning vigorously without creating any air movement whatsoever inside the restaurant. Over-the-top loud music that required yelling in order to communicate with the person sitting next to you and the acoustics of it was just making it even worse. As an appetizer, we had onion rings that came with sweet chili sauce and that was pretty decent to begin with. My S/O had the club sandwich with pasta salad. Really good portion size and good flavor, not skimping on the ingredients in the sandwich or the pasta salad side. His son had the fish and chips which also looked yummy and came with a boatload of fries and coleslaw and 2 huge chunks of battered fish. Sounds great so far, doesn't it? But the actual horror that came out of that kitchen, my ""salad"" as the main course literally threw me off so much that I genuinely could not find it in me to recommend this place to anyone, not even if it was the last place to go and get food at the lake. $14 Ahi Tuna Tartar - 3 unseasoned box chips, level one dry coleslaw, level 2 was about 2oz. of something that seemed like semi sushi grade tuna and finally on the 3rd level/chip were few red and yellow bell pepper shreds and black sesame seeds. All of this unseasoned (I really need to put emphasis on this), not marinated or tossed in some type of sauce/soy/whatever, thrown on a plate that was schmeared with some teriyaki reduction and a pretty pink flower and called a salad for $14. Literally the audacity of the price and this establishment to claim that this is a main course salad. I've never been more hungrier or angrier at a place. I think I should've protested immediately on the spot and have the dish returned and tell them they're being ridiculous, but you know, it's rude to be rude, right. Instead I am writing his Yelp review just so I can save the next life that wants to decide and order the Ahi Tuna Tartar and get epically disappointed. I think I'll just have some beers next time around.",1-star

Great, brand new menu with something for everyone. I had the quesadilla and my friend had the fish taco. We both felt the food is above average here. Attentive wait staff. Renovations are ongoing, but already much improved from Dillon's.",4-star
"This place needs a little fine touches, like completing the interior, but the service staff was outstanding and the food was very good. We just had the cheeseburger sliders and they hit the spot as well as the battered french fries. Its worth the outing to have breakfast or lunch at the lake. Hopefully mgnt will install a large tv for the football season.",4-star

"I guess it's all you can expect from a dock restaurant but I expected more. We camped at the lake and on our third morning we decided to eat breakfast out. This place was closest so we tried it. Well I didn't expect much but I did expect my food to be eatable. I had the biscuit and bacon gravy. stale or microwave biscuits came with toast? Why? No jelly for the toast. The gravy had some flavor but was lacking the creamy gravy like texture. I came back later to get something from the adjacent store. The shelves were void of anything but snacks and boat parts so I thought I'd get some side dishes from the grill. I ordered baked potatoes and potato salad, after being told that they did not have any baked potatoes. I ordered Mac n cheese (kraft) that was horrible, I had ordered the pasta salad but never got a chance to try it since I didn't get it. The potato salad was ok, I think it was Costco Potato salad. I'll just drive further next time.",2-star
Good food simple but the drinks are a big draw for locals I'm guessing. ... Huge water brought to the table especially appreciated after the hike! They let us have our dog on the outside area that is beside the gates that define the resturant... Since they are doing remodeling they consider the restaurant/bar the patio area is the inside of the Resturant our dog couldnt be directly at our table. They said the build out will be done in May..... Got busyas we were leaving. Only thing is they need more shade.,4-star
"We had a surprise 75th birthday luncheon at the Grill with 22 people attending. EVERYTHING was perfect. I had spoken with Matt prior to the date telling him how many would be attending. While they don't accept reservations, he suggested a time to arrive to have the best opportunity for group seating without much of a wait. There was no wait. Kristen had helped with ensuring appetizers would be brought to the tables while people were waiting for us to arrive. Our server, Brandi and another woman (so sorry I did not catch her name) were awesome. The food was perfect and everyone was served together. Even Dave who bused the table was great and joked with us. A perfect time for all. Highly recommend for any time you want great food, service, and a view to remember.",5-star
"Well the tourist trap mentality has finally caught up with this place. We came here 3 years ago it was half the size, no wait and $1 onion rings. Best value ever. Onion rings are now $4 and al the items are 12-15 dollars. Food was good. Waiter was nice and overall great experience eating on a dock in the lake. Great bloody Mary's and the drinks are not that expensive. Overall above average and worth the drive. Just wish it had stayed as it was a few years back but that's the price of progress.",4-star

"Needed oil for our boat and they charged us 40 dollars for the same thing Walmart carries for $12.00! Talk about screwing your customers! I could understand charging double but this was really gouging someone who needed help. They figure they have you over a barrel and there is nothing you can do about it! What a way to treat your customers! Then, went to the restaurant afterwards for convenience! Waited for 1.5 hrs to get our food! Had a party of 11 but there was no excuse for that! Be prepared to make waiting the most of your day while out on the lake. There is no indoor seating! Go to Dillon's across the lake if you want a huge menu, good prices and a break from the heat.",1-star

"What can I say, not a fan of this restaurant. Limited menu, with not much appeal. Appears they are attempting to be hipster gourmet, which means expensive, and very small portions. Ordered a riblet appetizer, the flavor of which was fine, but the ribs were incredibly tough, hard to get the limited meat off the bone, and mostly bone. I know, ribs are be definition are mostly bone, but these riblets were no more than an inch long (literally), and I paid $9 for 5 of them. I also ordered a flatbread, which was okay, the crust was undercooked. Not much of a fan of the draft beer selection - again they appear to going hipster with craft beers - just not my style for drinkability at the lake. I sincerely miss Dillions food, beer, bang for the buck, atmosphere, special events and entertainment. Two stars: one for location - anything at the lake is good. One for the free Chex mix at the bar - otherwise you will leave hungry. I hope this place comes around!",2-star
"Great restaurant on a floating dock on the lake, makes you feel like you're dining on a boat! The food was really good too. I don't have very high standards for places like this because there's no competition around. However, we were very pleasantly surprised with the quick service and great food. $36 for 3 meals seemed reasonable as well.",4-star
Yes it's a pub. Yes it serves beer and has UFC nights. Service is good and friendly that you'd expect at a neighbourhood bar. Funny thing is they seem to have a great kitchen. I have had surprisingly delicious fettuccini Alfredo and chicken parm here and other dishes you wouldn't expect. Regular stuff is always solid - wings crispy and flavours good. Fries are Swiss chalet style not McDonald's. anyhow as far as pubs go this one serves up solid food.,5-star
It took an hour for them to take our order then another hour and 15 mins to get all the food out to our party of 12. This was mostly because there was only 1 waitress for 6 tables also the management is oblivious to customers' needs. Don't waist your money.,1-star
"We came for dinner before a UFC night so it was pretty slow when we arrived. You seat yourself and staff comes and greets you shortly after. We were immediately asked for drinks and service for the night was very good and attentive. Food was just ok. We ordered the spinach dip to start with fish and chips + chicken pot pie for entrees. The dip was good. Large portion, with lots of fried pitas to dip. Fish was just ok; nothing special. Pot pie wasn't exactly what I expected. I images a creamy pie but instead it was more dry with chicken and veggies and gravy on top. It was ok, don't get me wrong, just not what I expected. Bill came to 43.45 for two people with one fountain pop. Not too bad pricing. Will probably be back, but will try new menu items Food 4/5 Service 5/5 Atmosphere 4/5 Value 4/5",4-star
"came here with a group of friends for the hockey game and UFC night. was disappointed with the TV settings, lack of sound and discoloured projector - not the type of place you'd enjoy watching a major fight. we complained a few times about the quality of the screen and lack of sound but apparently no one knew how to connect the main speaker system - one would think they'd be better prepared for a major event. I had the lamb Shepard's pie which was good other than the fact that it was super oily - to the point where, as much as I was enjoying it, I couldn't finish it. I felt like they were short staffed which caused the service to be really slow. not a place I'd return too!",1-star

"I walked into this ""Old World Irish Pub"" at 2pm Tuesday, sat down at the bar for ten minutes and the staff ignored me. It wasn't busy, maybe eight customers in total, yet the bartender thought it would be a better idea to chat up the local barflies than even acknowledge that I was sitting right in front of her. No worries, because it motivated me to travel over to the Boar and Wing at Kipling and Dundas for A-Plus service!",1-star
"Would have liked to order. I made eye contact with the pregnant waitress for a while. She was busy gossiping with the other blonde bar tender. She even had menus in her hand. I have eaten here before, a handful of times. The food is standard pub food. The burgers are kinda weak. Nothing extraordinary. I have no issues waiting to order if the place is busy. I do have issue when it's 1pm on a tuesday and the place is f*cking dead. I now go to st james gate, few minutes away on dundas. Their customer service has been top notch every visit and their food is good.",2-star

"Love this bar, and the staff! Whenever I've come here, I've always been greeted with warm and friendly service! They never have trouble altering something from the menu to fix a craving (like making a buffalo chicken wrap instead of a chicken caeser wrap). They're super good at remember orders, and have never had a problem with splitting bills! Fantastic place, laid-back atmosphere and always a good time! Surprisingly their chicken vindaloo is quite tasty!",5-star

Come in and try authentic Irish Chicken Fajita or better yet most popular Irish Spring Rolls with Curried House Dip, no no wait you must be dying for the ultimate Irish staple - the Maharajah's Chicken Vindaloo Curry! You get the picture.... Don't count on Irish stouts either, you won't find any. Anyway, if you're looking for a pub with usual pub food that's oozing with oil and the one that includes dishes from all over the globe (except Ireland that is) prepared by ""True Irish Chef""..this is the place to go.

"On a random Friday afternoon, my friend & I decided to pop my cherry with ""never have I ever been in a bar mid afternoon"". The parking lot is pretty decent for a strip plaza. The front provides a large section for smokers and possibly a patio in summer. Walking in, it's a very large place for a local bar. There's a whole dining section completely separated from the bar. The bar seemed to be busy regardless of the time. We walked in about 2 and didn't leave until about 7:30pm - which is a serious personal record. The day bartender was an older blonde lady with a very revealing shirt. She seemed nice enough when serving us. By 5:30 pm they dim the lights and music gets louder. The music is top hits so good for a wide range of age groups. Once evening hit, a few younger girls showed up for evening shift and wow...one was a fox. Think Jessica Alba cute sided with Jennifer Connolly sexy and she doesn't even know it. I later found out her name is Meagan. I tried to hit on her (for a friend of mine) but it didn't go too well. She got the wrong idea when I asked her if she was single. Is a wing woman really that unheard of? The girls serve everyone and split the tips. Which is pretty cool for the customers. They are always ensured speedy service. We had sweet potato fries with dip. They had everything covered in 1 trip. Napkins, side plates, ketchup, dip. At any point my beer would be low, they would ask if I wanted to refill. Now, my experience at bar service is very limited but from what I received here, I would definitely come back. The rest of the servers were friendly as well and seemed very chummy to the regulars. And boy, was there a lot of regulars. There is a small split to the immediate left of the entrance from the bar where you can have a private event. The room includes a few table/chairs and dart boards. With it's own entrance and an open window right to the bar, this is awesome for a group of friends to hang back, beer it up and throw some darts. Possible in that order. I like that it's sectioned off enough to have your own privacy but not excluding the friendly environment of the bar. There are tons of shirts, mugs and hats promoting the bar. With a name like Scruffy, I suppose that is kind of easy to promote. It seems like it must be quite popular since the package was a t-shirt, hat and a cup for $10.99. I did ask one of the bartenders if anyone had bough it and she replied that they were out of the t-shirts a few times. Cool beans. The rather interesting sight was at the end of the bar (closer to the main door and the sectioned off room) .There was a shelf full of random books. Now, I don't know why they have books at a crowded bar but I bet some of those titles have caused some serious laugh attacks. Especially if you are on your third beer..... and you have really good vision.......and you happen to catch the title ""supremely satisfying bathroom reader"". Which conveniently brings me to the bathrooms.. The bathrooms are seriously questionable. While space isn't an issue, cleanliness definitely is. Everything squeaks and some surfaces are oddly greasy. Overall, I will definitely be coming back. The atmosphere is very welcoming and even though the crowd is significantly older, I don't mind because it makes for excellent random stranger conversations and ""remember that time"" memories. fun fact : I should mention this place is a game changer for people watching. xoxo M.",4-star
"Me and a groups of friends decided to hit up Scruffy's for beer, laughs and good food. I still maintain that this place has above average bar food but beware the special orders! My friend ordered a steak with a side of bacon garlic mash potatoes for $12 (to f'ing die for). After finishing my appetizer I decided I too wanted to partake in mash potato goodness and asked the waitress if she could get me a side order. She said she wasn't sure if that was possible but would check with the kitchen and get back to me. Five minutes later, she came back to say that the order was placed. My side order was more like a mountain of potatoes in a bowl. There was so much there that I only ate half. When the bill came we all scratched our heads trying to figure out who had ordered a $10 poutine... apparently this was my side order of potatoes!!! $10 for potatoes!? The steak and potatoes were only $2 more! You would think the waitress would have mentioned something about the price if it was more than a reasonable under $5 (granted I didn't ask either!) Oh well. Lesson learned I guess! I still love this place.",4-star
"went for comedy/burlesque. $6 drink special was good, could have poured a little better. - comedy was OK, burlesque was more like performance artists. Just putting on a corset and straight jacket to sing ""crazy"" isn't what I considered burlesque. Funny, just not in the quirky way. - concrete floor and metal chairs were hard on my back. - unlike the signage, the place is in the NORTHWEST corner.",2-star
"Both times we have been there have been very enjoyable. We knew what to expect, a nice and slightly snooty wine bar. And we were happy! They have beer, and handcrafted cocktails as well. The bar menu is limited to charcuterie platters, but they are very very good!",4-star
"This review is strictly for the music venue never tried any of the food although the charcuterie plate April D had was looking very eye appealing! I came here support fellow yelper in our awesome yelp community Bobby Yang and his Unrivaled Players band. Unlike the last venue they played in here at Scullery U truly get too appreciate the music. The first thing that came too mind was MTV unplugged. Not sure if anyone remembers back in those days?? Or maybe just cause am that old. Not! Totally the vibe I got from the intimacy of such small venue. There not way that place holds hundred more like half that amount. The main stage area not really stage but more like open living room area. Not truck load of amps or equipment around just old fashion acoustic set up. The decor the cloth back drop all around, the rugs around the open living room/stage area, and felt like seeing Natalie Merchant on MTV unplugged. The sound system is on point. Never problem between both sets. Since such small venue you literally feel like part of the band the whole time right smack next to them. I would never think from the outside find such gem of venue in downtown more less basically in back of bar. Not sure the amount of bands or if they have concerts on weekly basis. If you know of band like that playing at Scullery would highly recommend it. One thing though about Scullery being such a small venue but more for the bar area up front. While waiting for the concert open the doors. It ridiculous HOT! Too much bodies in small area sucking up all the air. Couple of us hanging outside the front door get some fresh air. The venue itself has nice a/c so that was weird going from hot then cool. Felt so good! The bar set up really tiny but very artistic look and inside couple of booths that can get together with friends hang out drink talk stories at. The waitress felt like not around much the whole time from before the concert during the concert. No doubt Scullery bar that would come back again for concert. Or if going on bar crawl downtown I would make it one of the stops.",4-star
"Interesting concept, kitchen-like area for gathering and only for ages 25+, but fell flat for me. The bartenders were snooty and unhelpful when we asked them about the obscure liquors in their cocktails. The cocktails were on the pricey side, but not strong. I had high hopes for this place but I'll go elsewhere to pay $13 for juice. thanks.",3-star
"*** This review is for the performance section of the Scullery only *** Thanks to Ty W. and his excellent review, I was able to go from the Neonopolis garage directly to the Scullery for my first screening of the Las Vegas Film Festival. I think the room sign says 79 people capacity if I rememebr correctly. For the film festival, they have plush sofas in the front reserved for film makers and other VIPs. They then have several rows of standard metal chairs--not folding ones--for the audience. There was some difficulty with the sound last night and the movie had to be restarted and they still tinkered with it after the movie was going. Also, there were only a handful at this screening so we were told to move up. The sofa seats are quite comfortable. It's good the movie was good. I could have been asleep easily with the comfort I enjoyed. The room has another entrance, but access was controlled for the public through the Scullery's main entrance at 6th and Ogden. When leaving to go to the Inspire Theatre for the next screening, the narrow aisle by the booths and the people standing, talking, and drinking in the bar area made for some fine people dodging to get to the next venue two blocks away. It's an OK venue but not one you'd write home about.",3-star
"Mkay, Maybe I am a stupid but someone really should put a suite number on the yelp stuff:) It's Suite 190 for those that are drunk, stumbling around downtown trying to find this place. I really dig this place. It's got a very pacific northwest vibe. The booths are a bit cozy and dark which is actually very cool but I can see other yelpers whining about it as a negative. This isn't one of those seen and be seen places. It's purpose is far less superficial. - Make sure you ask for a house tour, the surprises are great:) The wine selection is pretty good but the cocktails are where it's at. Think of Downtown Cocktail rooms little brother but with a magnificent Charcuterie board. I loved the staff, they were great denizens of the place. I'll be back for sure.....",5-star
Last Night DowntownSoulLV played at Scullery . If your a musician/performer and have not seen the space you should! Their VIP room is very nice Private and Intimate. they also have a Improv Comedy Hour with Paul Mattingly and Matt Donnelly featuring Spadoni on the keys Wed's at 10! People there gave it great reviews but we'll see.,4-star
Awesome spot!!! Loved the food that Claudia prepared for us and the drinks were amazing!!! The staff here is really nice and attentive :),5-star
"The first thing I noticed about Scullery, before we even walked in, was a sign that said ""25+"". When I pointed it out, my BFF explained that the age minimum was one of the many reasons he loves hanging at Scullery. This new wine bar was our first stop of many during a downtown pub crawl (sprint?) and it helped start things off perfectly for us. We ordered a bottle of sparkling rosé and two cheese and charcuterie boards for the four of us. I liked every cheese on both boards, which almost never happens. I also appreciated the little touches of fruit preserves and the really excellent olive oil they drizzled over the bread selection that arrived with the meat and cheese. The super accommodating staff poured my BFF a generous taste of a wine he was interested in and were there with more bread, more side tables and pretty much anything else we needed at every turn. It's hard to believe that this elegant, light-filled space (we came at 18:00 in the summer) was formerly a 7-Eleven! We sat behind the the eight bar stools up front but Scullery's got much more room (that I never saw because I was having such a good time near the bar) including a 100 seat theatre! Scullery is a fantastic example of the changing face of downtown Las Vegas; I would love to be a regular here.",4-star
"One of the coolest aspects of being an avid Yelper is choosing the next location to review. Take downtown Las Vegas for instance. This place is just filled with energy and the presence of top notch pubs/restaurants. Very recently, a bar by the name of Scullery opened which immediately caught my attention. Not because of the prices, or the vibe, or even the staff. Initially, it was because of the name. I'm not going to lie. My first impression of the word was more of a morbid description. I knew my education failed me at that instance, so I took to the World Wide Web. It was fascinating to discover that the term ""scullery"" originated in Britain and Ireland and refers to a room in a house used to wash dishes and launder clothes, much like a kitchen. The word scullery evolved in the US to our present day utility or laundry room. Captivated by its background, I knew I had to check it out. Scullery is located on the corner of 6th and Ogden. This bar is nestled on the bottom level and East corner of the Ogden high rise apartments. Entering the joint, you'll notice a very airy and modern space. Painted exposed brick walls, dramatic vaulted ceilings and aesthetic archways. One of the immediate focal points is the bar backdrop. This 7 shelf unit holds spirits, wines, jams, oils, pasta and more. The vibe definitely exudes a kitchen like quality. Learning more about this place, the intent is to mimic the kitchen congregation theme at parties, which is, no matter how great a party is people still tend to gravitate towards the kitchen. This eclectic space includes bar top chairs, couch seating and of course, the hallway. Walk through the archway, down a dark path and you'll discover intimate booths for more of a cozier setting. At the end of the hallway is their second room, a Black Box theater. Black Box literally means a theater of 100 seats or less. This place holds true to its meaning and offers some awesome entertainment. The night I visited, there was a spoken word segment and improvisation classes. What a true delight! Overwhelmed by the never ending surprises Scullery offered, I decided to have a seat at the bar and order a few drinks. What's cool about Scullery is their extensive wine and beer list. They offer an array of reds, whites, bubbles, rose and brews for your enjoyment at a price range of $10-$15. On top of that, Scullery holds true to its name and offers an amazing spread from their gourmet pantry. Items like cheeses, olives, nuts, breads and cured meats are available for purchase. On this particular night, I decided to try a few of their specialty cocktails. Here's what I chose: The Royal Crashpad ($10.00), a cocktail made with Carlson's, Strega liqueur, Imbue Bittersweet vermouth, ginger ale and lemon juice. What's great about the first note in this drink is the ginger. Then, the Strega and Imbue combined makes for a very earthy herbal taste. The final note I got from that was more a licorice flavor. Sixth & Ogden ($11.00) contains Imbue Petal & Thorn vermouth, Maurin Quina liqueur and Botanuals. Although I have no idea what Botanuals are, I can tell you this drink is not for the weak! Lots of different notes and flavors will leave your taste buds super curious. I could taste a citrus flavor, elevated by an orange peel rub to the rim of the glass and a slight cinnamon taste which ended with a strong bitter finish. Downtown Afternoon ($11.00) was probably my favorite of the three I had that evening. It's made with Krogstad Aquavit, pineapple juice, lime juice and simple syrup. The prominent flavor is definitely the pineapple juice. What balances this drink out is the licorice and caraway taste which helps to break the sweetness of the pineapple. The word digestif was used a lot by the staff when describing these cocktails. Digestifs are drinks meant to be enjoyed after meals and the herbal notes you get from these drinks solidify the intent. Speaking of the staff, I'd like to give a warm shout out to Calvin our bartender and Jennifer our cocktail server. They were two very accommodating individuals, easy to get along with and full of charisma. At the end of my evening, I noticed a discrepancy on my bill. What impressed me the most was the way they handled my mention. Instead of trying to justify why the bill was incorrect, they simply took it back and corrected the issue. That's a HUGE win in my book. At the end of the day, hats off to Michael Cornthwaite and the crew at Future Restaurant Group. Scullery has shown some amazing potential and has definitely brought a unique footprint to the downtown scene. I don't know about you but whenever I have a party or a get together, somehow the kitchen really becomes the center of entertainment. The next time you're downtown, gravitate your party to this eclectic kitchen called Scullery. Order a drink at the bar, grab a bite from their gourmet pantry and enjoy some local entertainment in the Black Box theater. You'll be glad you di",4-star
"This place, located at the corner of 6th Street and Ogden, is an excellent addition and alternative to the DTLV/East Fremont Street District bar scene. The space is light and airy up front with high ceilings. Toward the back there are darker, more intimate booths. If you continue toward the back and around the corner, it opens up into a large room with a sizable movie screen and an upstairs area that's available for private events. This spot is a great place to come if you want a good selection of wine and craft cocktails with attentive but unintrusive service and want to avoid the chaos of East Fremont. Excellent for a date or catching up with a friend.",4-star
Everyone is very nice and helpful. We came to late for food and stuck around for drinks and had great conversations with the people here. My friend said that the food is great too! If you're looking for something chill with a great atmosphere I would highly recommend this place!,5-star
"According to a quick web search, I've learned that a scullery is a secondary room used for several things. It can be used for washing and cleaning, or even as an overflow kitchen. Apart from it's traditional use, I never saw bar in a description of scullery. Perhaps that's why we saw a couple try to bring their baby in? I don't know, but Scullery is definitely a bar and babies definitely aren't allowed. If you do plan to come here, don't bring your kids or you'll be kicked out and upset screaming that you'll ""never return"" as you walk out. Yes, that actually happened. For those with common sense, here's how to find Scullery. They are inside The Ogden and located on the far east side of the building, right on the corner of 6th and Ogden. When you walk in, you'll see a small bar with limited seating to your right and some small tables with additional seating to your left. Walk down the hallway and you'll find three 6-seat private booths with bathrooms oddly placed right next to the them. Then hidden way in the back is a 100 seat jazz theater. I can only assume the theater is where they plan to focus all their business with the bar and additional seating in the front used as a non-traditional scullery. See what I did there? During our visit, we spent the majority of our time in a private booth, which in my opinion are extremely uncomfortable for many reasons. The seats themselves suck and unless everyone in your party is 5' tall or less, expect to be bumping knees and elbows all night. There's also no barriers of any sort in the booth area or anywhere else. So, as you're watching everyone come in and out of the bathroom right next to your table the whole time, you also get to hear the echoes of noises from every other section of the place. If you wanted to hang out in the bar area, forget that. Once there's about 15-20 people in there, you won't even be able to move. So, even though we spent no time hanging out in the jazz room, I'd blindly recommend you just go straight there. Now, on to Scullery's two sided menu. The first is their ""Fine Intoxicants"" which feature 5 specialty cocktails, a fairly extensive wine list and 10 beers. Our somewhat waiter/bartender categorized the cocktails as digestif. I got to sample quite a few of the drinks from what everyone in our group ordered and I wasn't a fan of any but one, the Ogden Anthem. It's slightly cola like and even though I don't drink soda, I thought it was decent and it's definitely easy to drink. I ordered an Old Fashioned for myself which I didn't like at all. It felt like they made the drink and then filled the rest of the glass up with tap water. Lore got the Downtown Afternoon which tasted like straight up pineapple juice. With the majority of their cocktails running $10+, I just wasn't feeling the drinks at all. The other side of the menu is what the call the ""Gourmet Pantry"". Unfortunately, they don't have everything available just yet so they were only offering up sample boards. They had three to choose from, a small board for $17, a medium for $30 and a large for $50. Another employee came out to describe the boards and told us that the small is only designed for 1-2 people and we'd probably have a hard time splitting the large between the 6 of us. It was a bit disappointing as we all wanted to check out what they had but couldn't justify paying those prices. Apart from that, I didn't understand the service here. When we first arrived, it was dead and our bartender/waiter was pretty attentive and helpful. After we got our drinks, we pretty much never saw him again and just kept having random employees come ""check"" on us. There was no organization and I know they're new, but it seemed like the few people we dealt with were way too uninformed on what they were serving. We did have the food/beverage manager Jeremy come introduce himself which was nice but the service lacks. They even messed up our check. All in all, I just didn't dig this place. I wouldn't say I was in a rush to leave but I had no desire to stay and I definitely won't be coming back. Sorry Scullery, but you just didn't impress on any level for me.",1-star
"My favorite bar downtown! I absolutely love this place. Even when it's super crowded, the service is still fast and all the bartenders are fantastic. I also LOVE coming here for brunch and mimosas. So delicious! Everything I've ever ordered has been fantastic. This is a great place for people that want to have a good time but aren't in college and don't necessarily want to be surrounded by rowdy 21 year old students. It's so much fun and there's always fun lights and dancing. We always bring our friends from out of town here. Whether it be during the day for brunch and day drinks, or at night for drinks and darts. It's welcoming and the ambiance is lovely. Highly recommend!",5-star
"Went to Shamrock for food and drinks at around 11am. I got a Shamosa to drink, which is basically a mimosa but with some tequila as well. It is slightly on the pricier side, but it does the trick. I also got a cheeseburger, which was grilled perfectly and tasted great, not to mention a great price compared to surrounding restaurants. There are not many windows here, which makes the inside pretty dark, but the staff are friendly and helpful. There are a couple of TVs but they are pretty small, so it would not be my first choice to go to to watch a game, but overall there food, drinks, and staff are great and I would definitely come back!",3-star
"Great spot! We have always had stellar service from Luis. He's hilarious, attentive, and hard working. Even when he was slammed with customers (after the women's march), he remained friendly and focused. The food is delish, too! The grilled cheese is simple but yummy, as were the chicken strips. We shall return!",5-star
"Five stars for the Shamrock because much like the old Hard Rock Cafe motto of ""Love all, Serve All"" the Shamrock lives up to this. Bartenders are very approachable, the space is comfortable and not as divey as older reviews may have indicated. They make the drinks strong and they have a TERRIFIC wallet friendly happy hour. My favorite bartender is Wes and although I am sure he will not be there forever I sure wish he would stay there forever. The bar has a great neighborhood feel and it was nice to see it fill up after 10:00pm with a nice blend of guys in their 20's through....? All talking and seeming to have a nice time. The place is very straight friendly without pandering to them and I am always more than happy to pay this place a visit and that is saying a lot from a guy who has a hard time leaving the house let alone I am not a big drinker. I just go out for the social aspect every now and again and the Shamrock scratches that itch.",5-star
This place has amazing food - especially the brunch! Best Mimosa I've ever had - highly recommended. The staff is also super-friendly!,5-star
"I stopped in here to see if the hype was true and I'm happy say it was. Very friendly and warm atmosphere and good music, plus bartender Trevor was cool and made me feel right at home. I didn't get a chance to try any of the food but I'll definitely give it a shot on my next trip.",5-star
"Ladies bathroom was very messy - felt very uncomfortable using it! Overall, the food was good but I would not be surprised if the kitchen was not up to food code. My husband owns restaurants and is very certain.. . Strange, rude man at the door also - clearly not made for being the face of a business ! Bartender with colorful hair was charming but did not return change when asked and acted needlessly unkind to a young man near us. Not execllent. Will certainly not be going again. -Barb",1-star
"SHAMROCK forever! You really have to know what you're getting yourself into, though.... (the only way I can appropriately communicate the beauty of the Sham safely is through emojis which apparently aren't allowed here).",5-star
This is a fabulous bar! Great atmosphere awesome drinks and food. The food is way above your average bar fare. The weekend brunch is a MUST. Excellent staff and bartender's. One of the best bars in all of Madison!,5-star
"Great service and atmosphere. The happy hour has inexpensive drinks. The bar is very clean, nicely decorated and the bartender was excellent. Plus the music was very good.",5-star
"Food was mediocre but somewhat good. Pretty average burger but still worked well for lunch. The problem came when I came to pay. The burger was a dollar more than what their online menu listed. They didn't take credit cards, and the ATM in the back was charging a fee equal to my meal. This bar did have credit card terminals, and when I stated this, the waiter became rude, saying that they were not hooked up, but they knew what they were doing. Well, obviously not, since all other restaurants (and even most food carts) take credit cards. Even I take credit cards! I had to walk an extra 20 minutes during my lunch hour to get sassed at. Honestly, I was saddened to see such poor service from a Madison institution, but I'll stick with Paradise Lounge for my lunch hour.",2-star
"Robert Mahr has really turned this iconic bar into something to be proud of. Remodeled bar area and interior had made it more modern but yet kept the feel of the previous Shamrock and it's roots. Food is delicious with their new menu and of course check out Brunch every Saturday and Sunday, you will be hooked! DJ's every Thursday, Friday and Saturday! Happy Hour is always fun and drinks here are inexpensive but yet really good!",5-star
"I thought the dance floor was pretty good and the cover/drinks were nice and cheap - $3 cover, $2 tequila shots, and $10 for a Long Island pitcher. Using Plan B as the ""golden standard"", the people at Sotto seem a bit younger and less BDSM.Other than that, its a very similar experience but its right on State street and you can afford twice as many drinks.",5-star
"Nahhh... I'll pass. (My response anytime someone suggests coming here.) I've been in here a handful of times. It's not really that the experience was bad, but it just wasn't good either. It's really hit or miss at the bar. Sometimes drinks are great, sometimes they straight up suck. The people who have been here on the nights I too have been here have typically been bro-tastic 20-somethings who I have zero interest in being approached by, let alone actually dancing with. The location is pretty great. It's in a basement, which some may consider a pro while other's may think it a con. I think it works well. It gives it that dark and mysterious feeling. It's right off State Street, so it's really in the heart of it all. It has a lot of potential to really ramp up it's night club game. Someone with the right ideas and drive just needs to come along and help this place out.",2-star
"Could have potential to be a fun dance club if it had a good DJ. He was playing the most obscure, unknown dance songs as if to say ""Look at me, I'm a DJ and I know songs you don't know!"" Nobody was dancing because they didn't know the music; it was a very low energy place overall. Everyone was just kind of standing on the dance floor wondering what they were doing there. Besides that, it's literally a basement which happens to have a wooden dance floor and a bar with bored bartenders. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you like flaunting your knowledge of strange dance music in front of your friends.",1-star
"Sotto is like a burning trash heap that threw up on another burning trash heap, opened its doors, and called itself a bar. The DJ can't DJ for crap. He plays three seconds of every song and has horrible transitions. My cat would do a better job. Not to mention the bouncer will tell you your real Wisconsin ID is fake just because the signature is over the picture, when literally all new Wisconsin IDs have the signature over the picture. They don't have an ID scanner so they can refuse you entry for no reason. I hope I never have the misfortune of going to Sotto ever again.",1-star
"Sotto is one of those places that in theory sounds like a blast, but always seems to be a bit disappointing. The dance floor is located downstairs and tends to get extremely muggy as the night goes on. I would definitely recommend Sotto if you are looking for a fun place to let loose and have fun. Just be sure to bring cash because they sometimes have a cover at the door.",2-star
"Well it's been 4 months and I came back on a Friday night. I was hoping it got better. Nope. $2 cover. That's good, right? It conveys confidence! Walk downstairs and no ones here. If it was more than $2 I'd be cranky. Apparently that wasn't confidence speaking, it was just ""we know you'll prolly leave ASAP so we need a couple bucks first."" Head to the bar. $7 for less than a shot of well vodka. Hint: 3 1/2 count pour isn't much. Bar staff took 4 minutes to even notice me, which is odd cause after a groups of 5 that just arrived, there are now 19 people in this entire place. One of the bartenders is being trained by someone who's wearing a giant wrap/shawl thing that keeps drooping into the ice wells. Maybe I'll just have a beer after all. It's now 12:48 am and half the crowd isn't at the bar buying liquor--they're leaving to make it to happy hour somewhere fun. Myself included. Weird cause the music is better now, but the bar is still shitty. I could make this such a great place. But it's not mine so...beware all ye who enter",1-star
"I gave up... I have given this place so many chances. It used to be busy when it first was hot on the scene and I will say I had some pretty great times, but I swear you can hear the wind blow with tumbleweeds and all now... Let me tell you this: I went last month to give it yet another chance, and at 1am on a Friday, there were two people hanging out 1) the bartender 2) the dj. Don't go here if you want to dance... go to Plan B on Thursdays for 18&up night where they play hip-hop. This place is a bust and I am surprised it is still open. I don't want to be harsh, but you have to park far away and walk all the way to the bar and then downstairs where as we all know, doesn't work well for drunk people, all the while you have no idea there is literally one cricket in the corner and a lone bartender.",1-star
"Definetly one of the best dance clubs in downtown Madison. New dj's everybody, great drink specials, and a very friendly staff. It's also a great bonus when they throw their themed party's like glo night, ect.... I would highly a suggest checking it out!!!!!",5-star
DJs are assholes and don't listen to requests. They play songs from 6 years ago and pay zero attention to the fact that no one is dancing to their tired mixes.,1-star
"Sotto has potential. I haven't been in the building since it was Bullfeathers, and they've definitely cleaned it up. There's a lot of room for dancing, the bartenders are nice, and the vibe overall was really friendly. Why not three stars instead of two? - Bottom of the barrel drinks - my whiskey and seven gave me immediate gut-rot. - Really young clientele (which is fine/expected, but the owner had previously said in an interview they wanted to cater to an older crowd and everything about the place skews very young). - Really mediocre DJ. - The fact that when my friends requested ""My Chick Bad"" by Ludacris (they just learned a dance to it at Dance Fabulous heeeeeeeyyyyyyy) the DJ replied, ""That's too ghetto, I'll have to make a mashup because we don't want any trouble."" Incredible. Get a better/less vaguely-racist DJ (whoever was spinning on 10/21) and I'll reconsider you, Sotto.",2-star
"This update is long overdue. Since I initially posted this review, I've gone back...and I'm ashamed to admit this...1-2 times a week in the past two months. Okay, okay - I know, complete and total insanity, but there's a reason: my boyfriend started the keto diet back in February and apparently chicken wings are totally acceptable keto fare. With that in mind, when he first suggested we go back to this location, I was staunchly opposed. With some debate, I finally threw my hands up in the air and relented - at least I knew what to expect if they failed. That's when Alexis happened. Now, I shouldn't say this as if this was the first time we've crossed paths with her - we've had Alexis take care of us before, she's always a ray of sunshine, positive, bubbly, welcoming and thoughtful. She's the one who's always recalled our order perfectly and taken such great care of us. But she *is* the reason we've decided to continue our patronage to this location. I've pushed the prior experience to the depths of my mind and have decided to let it go as an off night for the waitress. Alexis is truly the best thing to happen to this location and we've continuously left her generous tips since to express our thanks for her consistent thoughtfulness, and warm demeanour. She is someone who you can truly tell genuinely loves her job, the people she works with and the customers. She always asks about things you've shared with her on previous visits - be it my boyfriend's keto diet, or DIY projects. We are continuously touched by the extra length she always goes to in an effort to make sure we're well taken care of. Thanks so much, Alexis!",5-star
"I would give this place 10 stars if I could. I have ALWAYS had a great time here and the waitresses have consistently been amazing! I love their garlic sauce and they always always always give it extra if I ask for it. But the location at finch and duffrine (sp?) is so bad that they charge for each tiny dip you ask for! Hence I NEVER go there anymore. Recently I have switched my lifestyle and the way I eat. I went to St Louise (the one I am reviewing) and reluctantly ask the waitress if she could accommodate my request. She not only accommodated my request she even suggested some ideas within my guidelines!!! I loved the experience! Then I went back again yesterday the same waitress attended to us. When I started telling her what I could and couldn't eat (thinking she must have forgotten me from the last time) she right away remembered me AND my requirements!!!! She was just awesome! All in all I LOVE this location and their business practices. Good service, good food, good people. Will continue to go back there - ALWAYS!",5-star
"Didn't think I would write a review for a franchise restaurant but I thought i should for this specific St. Louis location. Came to this location for the first time on a Tuesday night for their half price wings special. My boyfriend and I waited 10 minutes for our table which is pretty good compared to the other locations. We ordered right away when we got our table as we were starving..... We waited for a good 20 - 25 mins (at least) for our food to come which we thought it was unreasonably long. The first thing we noticed was the food portions were not up to the ""st Louis"" standard that we were used to at other locations. The order for 2 lbs of wings definitely looked more like 1.5lb instead. The wings were so dry and slighly burnt, they were just overcooked. This location really did not live up to the St Louis standard. It was really disappointing, dont think we will come back to this location.",2-star
"Come here every once in a while for a quick wings/fries meal. Aside from being really busy and crowded in the evenings it's mostly a good experience and good tasting food with a reasonable price especially on their 1/2 price wing night - probably better than Wild Wing i'd say. Only criticism would be cleanliness - i find the rags they clean down tables/surfaces with questionable as they don't look sanitary. I once witnessed one dropped on the floor, picked up, and left at the front desk check in counter, which was later used by another server to wipe down another table with.",4-star
"Awesome atmosphere, great food. Ordered wings, tasted great. Waitresses are awesome helpful. Although this location is a little small but is busy for a reason!",4-star
The food was great! Our server Cartier was both funny and knowledgable about the menu and drinks. Would definitely go back especially if she is working.,5-star
"I can now highly recommend the ribs, and also point out that, for wings, the suicide sauce is the best balance of heat and flavor. The service as always is fast, friendly, and top-notch. This is a *great* place to watch hockey games; full of great people but not too crowded, and the pouring of the ales doesn't skip a beat no matter how many they pack in. Still one of my favorite spots in Vaughan.",4-star
"Service is good. Tried the Chicken and waffles and pulled pork poutine...definitely would order again, bit want to try other items...hubby and I couldn't finish but packed to go to snack on later. We'll definitely be back since you can't find this place back home.",5-star
Wir waren sehr oft abends dort. Günstiges essen und Cocktails. Man kann dort Football und Baseball sehen und gemütlich an der Bar was essen und trinken. Ich habe jeden Besuch genossen,5-star
"My husband, 2 year old, 4 month old and I came here on a Wednesday. The location was packed. When we arrived and were seated we were only given one menu between us. Upon taking our orders we had to request a beverage for our son long after she brought our drinks. Wait time for food was reasonable given it was very busy. We received our food and it was typical bar food. During our meal our server never returned to ask if we wanted more water, or drink refills. When we were finished she did not ask if we wanted dessert or anything else and we had to wait a while to receive our bill. Overall, food was ok, service was poor.",2-star
"The service was really great, easy going yet attentive. The Bacon wrapped Mac n Cheese appetizer is a must try Really enjoyed the boneless wings (tried Buffalo and Cajun), and also the Tostada salad hit the spot. If you're feeling like wings and want great service, this is the joint.",5-star
Ate here a couple times. Good food and good service. Had a burger one time and tried chicken waffles for the first time ever on the second visit. Recommend this restaurant.,4-star
"Fastest service I ever got at a St.Louis, and on a Tuesday too! Hostess was courteous and offered us seating options, which I really appreciated, and the servers and waitresses were very nice. The food was on our table within 10 minutes of ordering and we were out in less than an hour. Ordered the Hot & Honey wings and my boyfriend got the Sweet and Spicy Sriracha. I expected Hot & Honey to taste like hot honey garlic, but it was more of a spicy and sweet BBQ flavour, so I asked for some honey garlic sauce on the side. The Sweet and Spicy Sriracha was really good. Both were 2 flames and I don't disagree. Definitely coming back to this location. I mean, Tuesday Wings and Movies? Heck yeah.",4-star
"Arrived here on a Tuesday with my cousin around 5pm. I was expecting the place to be packed (or so I'm familiar with other locations) but it had a nice crowd and we didn't have to wait for a table. They had an open patio but we decided on seats inside with a/c. Our server was very genuine and welcoming which ultimately made our dining experience that much better. We each ordered 2lbs of their original wings which came with a side of fries and dill sauce. The wait on the food was about 15 mins which wasn't noticeably long. The fries were fresh, hot, crispy and fluffy - paired perfectly with the dill! One thing I did notice about the sauce on the wings was that there was an excessive amount leftover which just pooled at the bottom of our bowls. This could be a good/bad thing depending on how you like your wings. The wings were on the smaller side but at the end of our meal, we were stuffed! Especially not having eaten anything prior, we didn't feel cheated on. Overall, I had a pleasant experience here and I would come back.",4-star
"Take out 2/22/15 Started to use cardboard boxes for take out... Price is $1 more than yonge and finch I always get 8 wings here and 9-10 at maple or yonge n finch Plus phoned order in, 10-15 minutes quoted... I ended up waiting another 15 min in store, its like they didnt trust me or forgot. sad... Down hill... Let me know when they fix their actions",1-star
"With the way the economy has been, it's always nice to get a good deal, bang for the buck if you will. My coworker and I came for Half Price wings. What more can you ask for? Delicious wings at half the price? Score! Melissa was our server for the evening. A very pleasant young lady she is. Very cheerful and welcoming. She knew exactly what beverages were available and what wasn't. Food came out lightning fast (hot) as if it was already waiting for us, made to order. Devilishly good it was. . What more can I say about St. Louis Vaughan, other than staff makes every customer feel like they're at home.",5-star
"Good St. Louis like food in a small bar and restaurant. This place just needs some more years on it. Plenty of televisions and hockey on every one. The food is good. The seasoning and spices are different and interesting. This is a chain restaurant and one of the better ones. Cold beer, good service and a warm place to relax in subzero temps. Give this place some wear and tear and you have a real winner!",3-star
"Stopped by on a cold Montreal night. Very spacious inside. Laid back atmosphere. Was choosing between two saisons, Station 7 and 55. The bartender recommended the lighter 7 to start. When I checked out, he gave me two complimentary samples, one for the 55, the other is the strong Kamarad Friedrich. Very friendly bartender and owner. Wish I had another night in town to go back there.",5-star
"Let me begin by saying ales are not something I naturally gravitate to, the fruity esters and spice notes of ales hold no allure as I much prefer the pure bitterness of noble hops in Pilsners, Largers and Helles beers. I generally opt for the bottom fermented cold largered beer types rather than the top fermented fruity ales with one exception the Kölsch Beers of Cologne which are top fermented using a special yeast that allows cold largering at an elevated temperature. So you can imagine what a surprise it was to encounter some exceptionally good tasting ales at Station Ho.St. Kiki, our bartender, made several outstanding recommendations and I must say these were some of the highlights of our Montreal Pub Crawl. First was 7 Sisters Maia Beligian Strong ale at 9% ABV what an astonishingly good tasting refreshing ale this was, it was followed by 7 Sisters Black Alcyone Saison IPA; yes, a black IPA that blew my son and I away; for me this was one of the biggest and best tasting surprises on the Crawl. Station Ho.St will now be a regular stop when I'm in Montreal, I encourage you to drop by and see if it doesn't become a regular stop for you as well.",4-star
"La carte de bière était intéressante. La terrasse est ensoleillée et le décors est au goût du jour...mais le service! Misère! Nous étions à la terrasse en début un samedi après-midi. Il y avait environ quatre clients, mais la serveuse n'est jamais sortie pour prendre notre commande, elle a pris 10 minutes pour nous servir deux bières et elle a réussi à oublier notre nourriture pour laquelle nous avons dû attendre un autre 10 minutes. Bref, mon expérience ne m'a pas donné le goût d'y revenir, malheureusement. Dommage, ça avait l'air chouette!",2-star
"After our visit, I'm not actually sure how this place is in business anymore. When we arrived at 9 or 10 PM on a Saturday, we weren't actually sure the place was open. No one was inside, and all the employees were sitting on the corner of the patio drinking and smoking. We were made to feel like we were really putting the staff out to serve us. Upon arrival there was one other table of 2 customers and after we left there were zero customers. They have a decent selection of beers...almost 15-20 on tap. I asked for some suggestions, and was provided with the verbal equivalent of a shrug. I enjoyed the gose (a salt beer style), but it was definitely not the best of that style I've had. Their food menu is incredibly limited and we ordered a trio of sausage, olives, and almonds. It was fine, but everything was straight from a jar. Definitely glad I didn't order a sandwich. This place has so much potential; however, their unwelcoming and completely unprofessional staff really ruin it. Maybe it was nice at one point, but with so few customers on a Saturday night, Station HO.ST won't be around much longer. Note: This is only the third review in the last 2 years, so all the positive reviews are rather out of date. I'd suggest you avoid it.",1-star
"Ce salon de dégustation, qui n'a de sobre que sa décoration, tombe à point, car il permet de déguster les bonnes bières de la microbrasserie Hopfenstark, ayant ses quartiers généraux à l'Assomption. Qui plus est, ne trouve pas leurs bières en bouteille qui veut ; elles se font plutôt rares sur les tablettes des dépanneurs spécialisés. Bref, pour ces raisons, la Station HO.ST, rustique à souhait, fleurant le bois à plein nez et plutôt discrète, nous ouvre ses portes à Montréal au grand bonheur de nos palais. Car leurs bières valent le détour. L'influence belge prédomine haut la main, alors à bon entendeur. Mais personnellement, j'ai un faible pour leurs quelques cuvées bien houblonnées : End of the Trail (American Pale Ale) et Postcolonial IPA, deux excellentes découvertes pour l'amateur d'amertume...",4-star
"West coast meets east, in fabulous form. For this displaced west coaster, I've found a hoppy slice of it here in Montreal. Hopfenstark's HO.ST has a quiet atmosphere with simple flair. There's no question it's the passion for beer here. As a fan of black IPA, they do not disappoint. Thankfully, this is not where the selection ends. Barrel aged barley wine, selections of Saison. A few guest taps. You can find a beer to suit all tastes. There are a few signs of the newness of the place and the growing pains that come with, for instance, they lost beers on a chalk board to reflect current taps but are spread and hard to read at a distance. (Tip: grab the printed version!) In general for the beer fan, or beer snob, the selection will not disappoint.",4-star
This place is a great new beer bar in town. The decor is quite nice and they have an excellent selection of beers on tap. I was quite a fan of the two that I tried. Follow the menu as opposed to the chalkboards by the bar to help you decide because it's a lot easier that way. This place is worth the visit and if you're a beer fan then you absolutely must try it out.,4-star
"Tsé, des fois, t'as juste envie d'aller prendre une bière et que ce soit elle la vedette de la soirée. Bien, c'est comme ça à Station HO.ST. Un bar simple, 'clean' et sans prétention qui met tout sont accent sur son offre houblonée et maltée! Salon de dégustation montréalais pour la bien réputée microbrasserie Hopfenstark à L'Assomption, Station HO.ST offre plusieurs styles de bières: des bières de style belge, d'autres sûres (mes préférées et, ma foi, trop rares!), d'autres bien houblonnées ou même fruitées; bref, on y trouve vraiment une belle variété. Et leur liste de whiskies promet! La seule chose qui manque, à mon avis : des portes de saloon à l'entrée. Ça irait vraiment bien avec le décor western du bar.",5-star
"Les bières de la brasserie Hopfenstark me plaisant beaucoup, j'avais très hâte de les voir ouvrir vitrine à Montréal, et ce d'autant plus que c'est tout près de chez moi, sur la rue Ontario. L'endroit est joli, tout de bois vêtu. C'est peut-être un peu trop espacé, par contre: Il y a beaucoup d'espace entre les tables et le bar et un peu trop entre les tables elles-mêmes, ce qui, conjugué avec les plafonds très hauts, donne une certaine impression de froideur et de vide. J'imagine que cet effet est atténué quand l'endroit est bondé... Je l'espère en tous cas... La carte des bière est impressionnante: 19 fûts, les deux fois où j'y suis allé, la grande majorité étant brassée par Hopfenstark. Ils ont aussi un cidre en fût. En dehors de l'espace plus ou moins bien exploité, 2 choses m'ont agacé dans ce bar, ce qui leur coûte 2 étoiles et ma clientèle pour un temps. D'abord, les bières ne sont pas assez froides. Quand tu prends une cask, tu t'y attends, mais une blanche chambrée, quand il fait 30 dehors, c'est assez décevant. L'autre problème, c'est le prix... Presque toutes les bières sont à 7$. Certaines les valent, mais pas la majorité. En plus, il n'y a pas de happy hour... De quoi vous donner envie rallonger un peu votre marche jusqu'au Cheval Blanc où la pinte est à 5$ jusqu'à 20H... S'ils pouvaient corriger ces deux derniers problèmes, c'est sûr qu'ils me verraient la binette de temps en temps. Et ce serait bien agréable, car ce sont d'excellents brasseurs.",3-star
"It wouldn't take much to improve the atmosphere here. For starters, since it's outdoors, how about some summer flowers? Also, the metal chairs are uncomfortable -- seat pads would help. The wine selection is uninspired -- Sycamore Lane and Flip Flop -- and the food isn't great. I ordered the Mediterranean Platter and was expecting fresh cucumber slices, feta, tomatoes, roasted red peppers, hummus and olives. But it only had hummus and an artichoke dip, with pita slices and a small dish of olives. The view of the tree tops is pretty, though. And being outdoors in nice weather is always preferable to being inside.",2-star
"This is a bistro? Really? And melba toast with chopped tomato and onion passes as bruschetta for $8? Do we want more ""crostini?"" Sure, but then we get 6 microwaved melba toast again. The menu is very, very limited and the choices are rather odd. Mojito was plenty strong, but didn't taste good, and $9. Beer selection is not well curated, but predictable and boring. View is nothing to see, kind of like the top of a parking ramp. No plants or effort to create any atmosphere. Sorry, but I would never suggest going here and would only come back if someone insisted.",2-star
"Went here before a movie and their food options were limited. We got Parmesan tots with spicy ""ketchups"" (yes, plural even though there was one spicy ketchup) and kettle chips with ""dips"" (guacamole and salsa). It's as if some guy in college was raiding his fridge to concoct this menu. The drinks were sub par, my wife's mojito wasn't great, and our waitress looked like she was on meth. There were 7 servers behind the rooftop bar, but service still sucked.",1-star
"this review is for what there calling madison_rooftop_tasteofsummer, I had the 10 dollar pastrami burger and 7 dollar calamari, calamari no red sauce barely enough calamari to satisfy a bird. Pastrami burger for 10 dollars you expect more then 1 slice, Seriously one small slice, 1 slice of pastrami are you kidding. it took me longer to read the 3 paragraph burger description of this burger then it took to eat it. I'm pretty sure this place is nothing like the real sundance except the prices. this place is lost and so is there menu, good luck",2-star
"I want to rate 608 higher but I've had so many sub-par experiences here. The wait to get a table is never long (1st star) and the drinks are pretty strong (2nd star). Unfortunately the wait for drinks is always long, even when there isn't many customers. The food takes equally long to get to your table, I've actually gotten a COLD sandwich because the turn around time was so long. The view in the summer is nice, sitting on the roof people watching after being couped up in an office all day is a excellent way to unwind. It's also nice to take your food and drink into the theatre with you if you can't finish in time for your movie.",2-star

"Never coming back here again. A party for a SEX OFFENDER?? Seriously? How do you expect any woman to ever feel safe in your establishment?? Not that safety was a thing before either, judging from the previous comments. Either way, not a big loss, this bar was already disgusting in every possible way. They should close it down, it's wasting a good location.",1-star
Absolutely love this place. The concept of skating in a bar is genius and the tallboy PBRs really top off the hipster vibe. Wish they were open more nights out of the week!,5-star
This was the most terrible experience I've ever had at a bar. The management here is awful and did nothing after we told them that one of their bouncers physically assaulted my girlfriend and i. They said it was his first day working there so it was fine. Never going back here and it's such a shame because it seemed to be a cool place. I'm so disgusted with the people running this place.,1-star
"I went to the restroom with my girlfriend.. We both went into the stall together. No one was there to tell us to not go in together, didn't seem to be a big deal. OUT OF NO WHERE.... some guy who apparently works there began yelling and banging on the stall door, so violently at us.. I couldn't even make out what he was saying. We were so terrified that we opened the door and he was pushing the door against me and physically assaulting both of us through the stall. Apparently he didn't like that we were both in the stall, but couldn't you ask us to just leave the stall or have someone working the bathroom if that was not allowed?! It was completely inappropriate and terrifying.. :( That same guy continued to chase me out of the bar while I cried. We left in tears and I came back to speak to the manager and he did not give one fuck about us. He said that employee was new so it was okay. I asked, 'what if we had been bleeding or he had broken my nose with the bathroom door?' And he responded with 'well that didn't happen did it?' This was one of the most fucked up experiences I've ever had a bar. I hope their owner sees this.. You don't deserve to own any kind of business with that attitude!!",1-star

The bar and venue are cool but the manager was completely unfair in paying the bands playing the venue. When we played there the he pocketed something like 80% of the door money and when we tried to discuss this with him he was extremely rude. Strongly advise bands to avoid this place.,1-star

"Went here for Mother's Day. Extremely disappointed. Totally overpriced for poor food. Two adults got salmon and it was over seasoned with pepper. The asparagus seemed to be grilled but tasted raw, which we had to pay extra for as a side. The broccoli was totally over cooked.

Wouldn't recommend wasting your time or money here...after we finished our meal my family decided that McDonald's would have been better.",1-star

Absolutely unbelievably terrible. Please don't go here.",1-star

"Once arriving- was told by the waitress that she was ""very busy but would provide her full attention to us as soon as she could"" and took our drink order. There was a large table of 6-8 beside us and maybe 3-4 tables with people at them, it was a dead zone honestly. We ordered 2 waters, kids sweet tea, and a beer. Waitress comes back with a water, sweet tea, kids water, no beer. No big deal.. things happen. We tell her, she fixes it. Order our food (2 steaks and a kids meal) and it takes about 30 minutes to come out. Ordered the steaks medium, came wayyyy undercooked. Rest of our food was cold. Waitress never comes to check on us, doesn't fill up drinks, etc. After waiting about 10 minutes after we are done eating (and there's only one other table with people at this point) we flag down a waiter to please ask our waitress for our check. She walks in the front door with another waitress and they were outside smoking! Got our check and we were charged for the adult sweet tea we never ordered. We just paid for it to get the heck out of there... pretty pricey dinner for mediocre food and absolutely horrible service. Oh, and still didn't receive the beer.. Save some money and get better food- go to Texas Roadhouse! There's always a long wait, but it's worth it for the food and service.",2-star

Then, we waited forever for our food, only for it to be so awful, as hungry as we were, none of us could eat much of it. Awful experience.",1-star
"We were searching for a steakhouse for my boyfriend's birthday, and after seeing how long the wait was at Texas Roadhouse, we decided to give this place a shot. We were NOT disappointed. They bring you out soft, round rolls with whipped butter. They were hot, fresh, and delicious. We got the crab cakes appetizer, and although we thought they would be bigger judging by the menu picture, they were still amazing. The aioli sauce they were served with was a great complement. I was pretty impressed that you have a choice of 3 side salads- house, Caesar, or wedge. The wedge did not disappoint. It was loaded with blue cheese & bacon. My boyfriend got the Caesar, and also loved it. For our entrees, I got the Ribeye encrusted in peppercorn, and topped with creamy sauce. It was full of flavor. He got the top sirloin and also loved it. We were impressed that our steaks were cooked to the perfect temp. Our server, Shawn, was very attentive. We never had an empty drink. Overall, a great experience. $60 for 2 (no alcohol) is pretty great for a steakhouse. We will definitely be back.",4-star

"This place needs some work. The booths are dirty and the food leaves much to be desired. My steak and shrimp were over cooked.

"The food for this franchise is great. The location is great, but unfortunately the staff here is neglectful I feel. It may have been understaffed but I don't understand why when I was there is was for Father's Day weekend so you would think a restaurant would be on the'r A game for a celebrating weekend. Our waitress was nice but she was also working the bar? I have never been to a restaurant the bartender also waited tables; typically the bartender tended to patrons at the bar with food and drink. Ittook a long time to get our drinks- water. Then when we ordered a beer it took about 7-10 minutes after our food arrived to even get the beer.

I liked the atmosphere (but as I say in most restaurants, turn down the music). Our waiter was attentive but wasn't in our faces ever 5 seconds. That is a real plus to me since we wanted to talk. Our food came at a reasonable pace and not one thing right on top of the other. Would definitely go back.",5-star
"I wish there was a 2.5 I could mark. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. It was just okay. The food was decent and so was the service, but nothing to get excited about. However there were a couple things that just made me scratch my head: I got a bowl of soup and it was brought to me with a plastic spoon. No explanation was given as to why. Soup was a little tough to enjoy with the smaller than average plastic spoon. Secondly, I received two refills on my beverage. Even though she brought my original drink with ice in it, both refills had no ice at all. When I looked around the restaurant I saw other glasses with ice, so I am not sure why... Again, no explanation. As I said before, the food and service were adequate, but when I go out to eat I am really looking for good to great. This was simply okay.",2-star
"We had a party of 8 with no waiting, lots of different items tried, chicken fried steak looked like the best, nice sized portion good looking gravy the brisket sandwich was good looking but a taste disappointment, pulled vs sliced meat could have been anything, and served with a Carolina BBQ sauce, not what I'd expect from Texas. The ribeye dip was large and tasteless, not sure where the get the meat, looks the part but no flavor to speak of. The Tuna looked great and was cooked to order with a nice mixed greens salad on the side, quite the surprise. The peppercorn ribeye was cooked to order well encrusted with cracked black pepper corns, loaded smashed potatoes were OK, again the beef looked the part but lacked taste. The bone in ribeye was the greatest disappointment, it has grill marked but is very very greasy not what you'd expect from grilled meat. Overcooked and tasyless, hardly worth the effort to complain. The toffee bread pudding was the only item worth returning for, oh well don't waste your time.",2-star
"The service was poor and the food was even worse. Our food came out all together with the exception of our daughters plate. We waited an additional 15 mins for her food so ours was cold when we finally ate. I never received my salad or some of the sides we ordered, which was fine because it was gross. My daughters steak was way over cooked. She ordered medium rare and it came out well. If you want a good steak and good service, don't stop here!",1-star
"To avoid the crowd we came here with the kids Thanksgiving evening. Staff greeted us very kindly and took care of us in a very professional manner and the food was not any less to rave about. Between the four of us we tried all different kinds of meals, ribs, ribeye, filet, salads and all of them were excellent, even the sweet tea was great. Everything fresh and flavorful. We are pretty particular about our food and this is a place we will come back to.",5-star
"We've been here several times and yet to have a bad steak. It's a step up from your local Long Horn, Roadhouse, or Outback. Staff is professional and the menu contains a bit more creativity than a blooming onion! Clean with professional service at a decent price. What more do you want. I don't understand why people bash a place for being exactly what it is marketed to be. You can't expect to go into this restaurant and get the same menu as Del Frisco's or Capital Grille and still want to show up in your shorts and sneakers and pay the prices they have. Change your shorts for some pants and put on some shoes and make reservations at one of those restaurants and pay the fine dining price. FYI, it's always a good idea if you check a menu out before you go so you don't have to be disappointed they don't offer ""your type of food""!",4-star
"We went here for lunch yesterday, the food was fine, nothing too special as my steak was a bit overdone and my husbands was under but our server was FANTASTIC so based on that I gave this place 3 stars. I have been here before and really had a fantastic meal but this time it didn't quite measure up food wise. I would however go back in hopes to experience the food we had had the first time",4-star
"Bad. That was the general experience we had at the Texas Land & Cattle. Id' give it 1.5 stars if I could, but it doesn't deserve 2. We went early on a Saturday evening. The waitress was entirely inept. She showed up late to our table after getting ""reamed out"" (her words) and everything was late. Our French Onion soup finally showed up AFTER we had our meals! she told us it's because the first order had gotten cold. Well, your job is to get our food out while it's hot. Getting our drinks was like pulling teeth. The service to the table next to us was a different waitress, but with the same results. The food wasn't much better. My ""12 oz"" ribeye was a pathetic 1/2 inch thick steak. So was my son's. The lettuce was wilted, potatoes undercooked and just most everything was pretty bland. The house special sirloin was pretty decent, but that was about it. And the soup - when we finally got it - was probably one of the worst renditions of French Onion soup that I've ever had. Overall, the food was overpriced, poorly cooked and relatively bland. This place isn't worth your time.",1-star
"My husband and I went to this establishment for the first time and had HORRIBLE SERVICE! 10 minutes after we were seated at our table, no one acknowledged we were there. None of the servers took the time to ask what we wanted to drink or stopped by our table just to say ""I'll be right with you"". I brought this to the attention of the manager, Kelsey, who said it was unacceptable and she would send a server to our table right away. We waited another 5 minutes and still no one came to our table. My husband and I were fed up with the rude service and left. It's just a coincidence that my husband and I were the only minorities in the restaurant at the time. Everyone else was being waited on. We will NEVER go back to this restaurant. I'll be sure to tell all of our friends and family to do the same. The service we experienced at this establishment isn't even worth one star!",1-star
"Food was average, beer on tap was warm, service, while friendly, was ridiculously slow for 3:30 on a Friday with 2 other tables occupied. Highlight was the fried pickle appetizer...perfectly fried with great dipping sauce. Lowlight, other than snail service, was the steak nachos, which was actually like 10 chips topped with a little cheese & a cube of steak. Burgers were average & fries were not hot. Ludicrous 30% tip added to bill! If I'm going to waste 2 hours of my life and $200 (party of 5), I better be wowed...and I wasn't.",1-star
"Just came back from TXLC. It was one of the worst dinning experience that I ever had. My wife and I actually went there quite often actually because she loved the Texas bone-in-ribeye. My mother in law was in town so we took her there and ordered the same thing. They both had the bone-in ribeye and I had the regular ribeye. However, as soon as the bone-in-ribeye came to the table, you can tell there's an unpleasant smell when it got close. They smells like they have been sit there unfrozen for a while and rotten, not fresh at all. My Ribeye came out ok. We notify our server and she took cared of it and got us two new ones, but when the new ones came to our table, one of the steak had the same problem again and I was really pissed. I mean....you have to be kidding me if this happens....not once but TWICE. The manager apologized to us again but she was not very sincere and thought we were joking. This is a terrible place in terms of food qualify and consistency. We will not go back again and I used to recommend my friends to go but please don't go anymore. Unless you are not worrying about going to hospital from food poisoning.",1-star
"It's been a long time since my last visit to a Texas Land & Cattle...and it will be a very, very long time before I return again. Knowing that a large group of us were going to meet here, I felt like a proud Texan to go somewhere with Texas in the name (I lived there for 7 years, how could I not get out without some pride?). However, this place would make Texas ashamed. The space was great and they had a room reserved for our group. It provided a great intimate setting for us! The service was good. The food was its downfall. The appetizers were average and seemed factory processed (you know, open the box type). The steak was dry, hard to chew, and salty...blah. For the price per entree, they should step up the quality. Good night out with the group, great location...not a fan of the food.",2-star
We've been regulars at Thai basil for years but recently there must have been a change in chefs because we ordered our usual and the shrimp was rubbery and the cashew sautée had absolutely no flavor even tho I ordered it hot. We reordered thinking they made a mistake and the shrimp came rubbery again and with no flavor. We walked out. We're removing this restaurant from our regular Friday night rotation. It was horrible!!!,1-star
Soooo disappointing. I've been going here for 2 years and loved their shrimp Pad Thai. Always great and lots of good shrimp. Tonight the shrimp was horrible like old and rubbery and the seasoning was not the same. Sent back the dish and it came out the same. Told the chef was new and then that the chef wasn't new. Left without eating.,2-star
"We ordered the Drunken Noodle with crispy tofu & the veggie egg rolls & had it delivered. The food was hot & scrumptious. The egg rolls were delicious & crispy. The portions were substantial, enough for two meals! Will definitely order again soon, yummy!",5-star
"My husband and I always go to thai restaurant. I love this place and definitely I recommend this place, we ordered path thai and chicken carry it was fabulous. Hope you like and enjoy your thai food if you guys are going. Soooooo gooood :) :)",5-star
"Food was really good. We had the chicken satay, red curry and ginger chicken. Service was beyond horrible. They were not busy and we waited over 30 min for our food. They barely gave us enough rice to begin with and charged us a 1.50 for more. Won't ever be going back here.",2-star
"I will NEVER return to this Thai Basil - what a scam !! Myself and my dining companion both ordered the same dish. It was fine - nothing special nothing horrible. However, once we received the bill we were charged $2.00 more for each dish. When I politely brought the issue to the manager (I guess - if she is she is HORRIBLE !!) she advised me that they have a small - tiny advisement at the bottom of the menu that prices are subject to change. Ha ha ha - you have got to be kidding me !! I advised her that they should be verbally advising their customers when there is a price change. I advised her that it was unacceptable and her reply was ""It is no big deal"". She is going to tell me what is and isn't a big deal to our pocketbook - I don't think so !! She should have eaten the $4.00 because we have not been back and will never go back. For $4.00 she has lost hundreds of dollars in future business because my dining partner was a regular guest for years at that Thai Basil- NOT a smart move !!",1-star
"Almost sure I tasted ketchup In the Pad Thai that was not spicy at a number 3. If not, it really lacked on that magical Thai balance of flavor with little to no fish sauce used. Mediocre would be a stretch for this joint that uses Romain or green leaf lettuce in its ""Fresh Roll"". No herbs. Cutting corners is easy I suppose when there is no real competition within a few miles. I could go on about the poor knife cuts and onions larger than 1.5"" chunks that eat almost raw at that size and so on, but I've vented enough.",1-star
"My family and I always come to this restaurant when we are in the mood for some good Thai food. They are awesome for ordering to go but they also provide good service in the restaurant itself. Rama's favorite and drunken noodles are our go to dishes that are ""must haves"" for us. They definitely don't go light on the spice you can order from a range of 1-5. I like spicy but a 1 is good enough for me. If you really really like spicy spicy food then go for a 5. My dad orders his as a 5 and isn't disappointed. We tried the coconut soup and it was amazing! Great flavor and exactly what we wanted. I got a jasmine tea and was not impressed, didn't have much flavor. I would stick to the traditional Thai tea in the future.",5-star
"We ordered delivery from Thai Basil and were very disappointed with the food. The lunch specials were cheap ($10 or less) but the food was greasy and in some cases tasted off. My green curry was the one dish that was okay, but the spring roll that came with it was very oily and seemed kind of old. The yellow curry was unusually yellow, even for a Thai curry, and we realized that it was because there was so much turmeric in it. The sauce was pretty bitter because of the turmeric. The pad Thai was pretty flavorless and we weren't able to eat the stirfry dishes since they just smelled a little off. Unfortunately we won't be getting food from here again. Keeping this at two stars since one out of the five orders were okay, the price is cheap, and they did actually include napkins and silverware.",2-star
This Thai Basil could very well be the best Thai in valley. The pad Thai are always on point with flavor and heat. Can't beat their lunch specials.,5-star
"I've been here few times and they never disappoint to satisfy my Thai curry cravings. Their menu is simple. You can order any dish and then choose protein including lamb, tofu, chicken, beef and shrimp. Every dish can be made to order with spice level from 1 to 5. One is very mild, while 5 is Thai spicy and believe me, it pretty spicy. Lunch entree comes with cup of soup. The entree portions are not too big or small, it's just right. Their ingredients are very fresh and most of dishes comes with generous serving of vegetables. The service can be little slow, but reasonable during busy lunch hour.",4-star
My friend and I were craving some Thai Iced Tea and Thai Curry - luckily this place was open until 9:30pm. We felt bad going relatively close to closing time but we got in around 8:40pm and tried to get out of there as fast as possible. The waitresses were nice and accommodating. The Yellow Curry was delicious! I liked their yellow Curry more than Thai Elephant Bistro's. Definitely will be back again!,5-star
"It should have been a red flag that the whole restaurant was empty. The food was awful, dry rice noodles with no flavor. The service was awful Considering we were the only ones there. I didn't eat more than one bite and not one of the staff said - is everything ok? Awful!",1-star
"In their defense, the pad see ew and the yellow curry are decent, very average. everything else we've tried was bad. and i mean real bad. greasy, over fried, and just a general poor quality. I would order to go for a pasta dish (but only because it's the only thai place near me) but wouldn't try anything else on the menu.",1-star
If I don't want to cook I can always count on Thai Basil! The coconut curry dish and bbq chicken are our favorites! My kids love when I come home with food from here. One kid loves there side order of chicken in a secret sauce and the other kid loves rice noodles in a secret sauce... No matter which chef is working both know who I am and make my kids there dishes exactly how they like it! Thank you,5-star
We were desperate to have a good Thai experience in new Scottsdale. Thai basil didn't disappoint. The pad Thai was seriously great. Washed it down with a couple of Thai ice teas and wow what a great treat! Highly recommended.,5-star
"We love the Thai food here. Small Thai restaurant with great food. We tent to get the same thing every-time, which is egg rolls or pot stickers and chicken curry and rice which we split. This is our absolute go to Thai food. Always good. We will be back.",5-star
First of all the food is good. I gave them a one star because the service is horrible. It is so slow and there are a lot of tables even available. It is not that crazy busy! My food is a little bit spicy so I ask for an ice green tea refill and takes forever!. I just bare the spice feeling on my mouth!..,1-star
"I love Thai Basil Signature, not only is the food delicious but service is always spot on. I am a sucker for good spring rolls, that thin deep fried tofu skin, the rice noodles, and veggies... and let me tell you theirs don't disappoint. Their peanut (panag) curry is yummy and I adore their pad see ew noodles! My go to local Thai joint!",5-star
"We get take out from here frequently. Favs are Pad Thai, Thai fried rice and peanut curry. It's good and does the job when we're hungry for Thai food. I like that you can specify how spicy that you want your dishes to be since I don't like spicy but the hubs does.",4-star

Amazing pho won ton soup, curry noodles, drunken noodles, chicken satay and the pot stickers. This place is really really good. I have no idea how others have rated this low. It really deserves 5 stars.",5-star
"Found this gem on Yelp and absolutely love it. We love the ""Drunken"" Noodles and Coconut Soup. They are a couple of our favorite dishes and have always been pretty consistent in taste. Dine in or take out! The staff is extremely attentive and very nice. We have recommended this restaurant to our friends and will continue to come back.",4-star

"I've been eating my way through the menu here and so far I've been impressed with the consistency of the food, freshness of ingredients and general level of service. Heat levels are hard to come by, Thai hot is not the adventure it is at other eateries but at least there is something there. Lunch portion wise it's almost not enough, in relation to the two I used to frequent in Scottsdale it's not that it's tiny just seems off for the area.",4-star
"Service was OK, nothing exceptional. Price was fair, food good, ambiance relaxing. I will be back again when I'm in the area.",4-star
"Best place to eat Thai in AZ! My favorites are Pad Thai, Nam Sad, Tom Kah, and Pad Broccoli. The place is about 1100 sq feet but has a cool relaxed feel and if you want, you can order in advance and just pick it up-no delivery.",5-star
Very nice people. Good service. Drunken noodles spiced 2+ on a scale of 1 to 3 were great. Very fresh ingredients. Tasty crab puffs. My wife enjoyed chicken noodles. The sticky rice served too early and rates 1star. Overall a place I will happily return to.,4-star
I always get the same meal and enjoy it every time. I always get the Pha Nang (Spelling?) I always add the spiced diced peppors for that special flavor served from a side tray.,3-star
"Thanks to reading the other posts we were already prepared for less than stellar service but to be honest..good food trumps bad service any day. WE were NOT disappointed! Food was great and although it was tamed down a little too much for my liking (Spicy levels), we were able to juice it up with the proper sauce tray that had chili paste and chile oil. Service was a little slow and disorganized but our server and others there were VERY friendly and went out of their way to make sure that we enjoyed our meal. We will be going back soon...especially since our waitress informed us that they will be adding a sushi bar in the next few weeks! Obviously going a little off the ""thai food"" route but who doesn' t like sushi?!",5-star
"Great staff and ambience. Has the feel of an old Irish pub. I go there very often, and I had my wife's 40th birthday party there, where they booked off a section for 35 people. It went flawlessly! It was easy dealing with Dylan for planning the party, and the entire crew did awesome! Special thanks to Sierra and Gary!",5-star
"If you see my other reviews, I've come to realize that I'm a picky eater. I'll eat almost anything, but if you're making me pay more than $5 for it, I'm expecting it to be good. Enter Berwick! It's seat yourself (like most pubs). There is quite a bit of seating, but you may have a hard time finding a place during a hockey game. The menu is a good size, not too big and not too small. The waitresses are nice, the food comes quickly, and the food is good and in fairly plentiful portions. I tend to stick to the same things in the menu, but when I'm getting adventurous, I have yet to find something I didn't like. In short, it's probably one of the better restaurants on the city. For $15 a meal, I feel like I'm getting my money's worth.",5-star
Great service and staff. The place is always clean. During hockey season it can be hard to find parking and a table. But normally you don't have to wait to long before getting a table. The bartenders are very good at recommending drinks if you aren't sure what to get!,4-star
"We come here regularly for wing nights. The atmosphere is fun, the food is good, and the bartenders are eye candy! Wednesday is my favourite night of the week!",5-star
Good fun neighborhood bar. Meet your friends and tip a few. Excellent fried pickles!! I didn't even know there was such a thing ... Excellent I mean!,4-star
"Always good food and service at the Berwick. The pulled pork tacos are awesome. So is everything else to be honest. If something isn't just right, they fix it. Great neighborhood pub. The staff are friendly and fun.",5-star
"Nachos are boring :( waitresses seem uninterested, dropped the food on the table and walked away...maybe because they knew the food was less than par and didn't want feed back...atmosphere is ok but wouldn't come here for the food",2-star
"Oh Berwick, you are not what you seem! When we went here for the first time I was thinking... pub food, standard beer list, standard staff... but I was quite impressed that it was nothing like my expectations! I have now been about 3-4 times and after each visit I leave satisfied. The food is really good, they have a nice beer list to choose from and the service is great. A couple things we have tried here in the past were the wings, lemon blueberry chicken salad, veggie and chicken souvlaki wraps, pork tacos (3) and a burger with sweet potato and waffle fries. All these dishes were nicely crafted and delicious! This place may look from the outside and inside as just an average watering hole but don't be fooled, go and try it out - I don't think you'll be disappointed!",4-star
"I must say, the Korean bartender that works Friday nights is a fine gentleman indeed. He serves up some of the tastiest beverages this side of Seoul!",5-star
"I have been going here since it opened, and not just because it is my local haunt. 20 cent wing night Wednesday is the biggest draw - go early as it is always busy! I arrived at 6pm on Wednesday and had to wait for a table nearly 15 minutes. After the manager seated us he immediately took our order as well. Impressive. They also have wings on special on Monday for 25 cents which is not as busy. Very decent draught selection, and plenty of local and imports here as well. Bartender and waitresses are very attentive and service is top notch. Lots of TVs throughout with a few big screens so no bad seat to watch the games and not miss any of the action. They also have a south facing patio welcomes the afternoon and evening crowd in the summer.",5-star
Wednesday is wing night! Great wings and even better service by Gary the bartender! The food is always good as is the service. When ever you enter the pub you are always welcomed and all of the servers are friendly. The bartender Gary is always friendly and very attentive. Gary is one of the best servers that there is in Calgary!,5-star
"Favorite place in Noda. Some pretty sweet games inside and some outdoor fun when it's nice out (or dry at least). Cornhole, giant jenga, ring toss game. Great drink prices and staff is always friendly. Wish this place was open during the day too!",5-star
"I used to love coming here but in the last few months every employee here has been as rude as possible. From the bouncers, yelling at my friends and I for absolutely nothing saying we ""weren't walking past the bathrooms"" fast enough. The DJ asked for $25 for us to request a song after I have spent over $60 on drinks and about $20 on games. Will not be returning after the awful service I received tonight.",1-star
"Just plain fun. Ms PacMan? Got it. Giant Jenga? Got it. Skee Ball? Got it but bragging rights only (but no tickets pop out). Good beer sleection, check. Beer pong table, yep. Nice patio too. Fun bar in NODA. Look forward to heading back.",5-star
"This is a fun dive-bar. There are plenty of games to play inside and outdoors, an ATM if you need cash--and a jukebox to play music. They have drink specials that are pretty good, but in general their prices are relatively low to start with. It's a big space, however, it'll fill up on the weekend--this is one of the hot spots in NoDa, worth checking out!",4-star
"The good old pig! Always a fun time! This bar is loaded with video games, giant life sized games like Jenga, a see saw, and pretty good music. A huge place and also an outdoor patio with ample seating and room to move around. The service is ok, hit or miss. The drinks are decent depending on who makes them. The had a lemonade drink on special that was delicious. I recommend trying it if they have it again. They do have drink specials often, which is nice.",4-star
"The blind pig is always a fun stop regardless if you have a large or small crowd. Feels like a dive with a bunch of fun games that are good for a wide array of crowds (seriously - everything from board games, BP, air hockey, and corn hole). Also they never charge a cover and seem to have something decent on special every night of the week. Also make sure to send a fun text and see who responds on the big wall.",4-star
Been here quite a few times with large groups as well as just my girlfriend and I. It is always a great atmosphere full of awesome people and we always enjoy ourselves. Definitely a great place to go if you want to go to a bar and have fun with strangers because all the games inside really give you the opportunity to connect. The bartenders and staff are friendly and great and they always have awesome drink specials. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to try somewhere new.,5-star
"They have some games like air hockey, skee-ball, darts, pool tables and corn hole as well as some others. The outdoor area is pretty large with some additional games too. The beer is cheap for the neighborhood but the selection isn't up to par. The staff isn't the friendliest, especially the door guy at night. The bartenders sell more fireball shots than I would care to count at night but it can be cool on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.",2-star
"So this is the thing about this bar, I'm here on a Saturday night up at the bar and I completely get skipped over by the suppose GM Ashley. Now I understand that if I'm up at the bar I'm suppose to know what I want but o skip over me in mid sentence is a issue. I mean I'm from MD and go to DC all the time where the bar are a thousand times more packed, but to just skip over a customer is unacceptable. Then to top that with security being a little to aggressive with my friend, who is a female is something totally different. Don't run up on a female like she some male. The chief security guard (that not his title but he's over all the security guards) did come to speak to me, which I appreciated to diffuse the situation. But nevertheless the way it was handled was uncalled. In end me and group I was with ended getting kicked out, when all we wanted was to get our drinks and play some corn hole in the back. The possibly of me coming back is slim, but if it happens hopefully the service will be better.",1-star
Very quaint and friendly. This was a stop on our bike trolley bar crawl. They have daily specials so you didn't feel like you're breaking the bank. Well definitely make this a regular pit stop.,5-star
"Great place to come hang out and play different type of arcade game, throw darts, and play some of your favorite childhood board games with friends and family (21+ of course).",5-star
"Such an awesome spot located in NoDa (North Davidson) which features a few games but the fun is located outside. Drinks were reasonably priced and the staff was attentive to those waiting for drinks. If you're a beer drinker, they have a spot at the entrance to grab a quick beer with really no waiting. After grabbing your drink, head outside for some floor model Connect 4 or Jinga. There are other games happening but these were my favorite and met some really awesome people. Very diverse crowd which I really enjoyed. The games on the inside are pretty basic but you can still have a bit of fun inside and the music is heard throughout the bar and the music was very diverse and great. Looking for a good night of fun, music, games, drinking & just meeting random people check out this spot it'll be a 5 Star Night.",5-star
"If you are out and looking for just a bar scene then this will be the place anyone would suggest to you. It gets very crowded on the weekend, but is a fun place to go. They have an outdoor area that has corn hole, and life size jenga! Plus it's beside the dog bar so you get a chance to look over the fence and see some cute doggies! Inside they have some arcade games, pool table, darts, life size connect the dots, and a peer pong table. It's a college party on the town! It can take awhile to get served at the bar, but that's understandable because it gets very crowded. On Friday and Saturday night there are beer tubs for a quick PBR or other cheap beer and they have DJs which is fun. If you don't like crowded, loud bars then stay away from here on the weekend. Also if you come out later, say past 11pm, then you might have to wait in a line to get in. But overall it's a fun place to go to feel like a college kid again!",4-star
"If you mention NoDa to anyone that knows this neighborhood then this will be the first bar that pops into your head. On the corner of what you would consider the start of NoDa this is where it's popping on the weekends. This place has it all.. Except food but that's okay because NoDa has sooo many fabulous places to eat :) If you get there late on a happening night expect a small line outside and possibly a little wait if it's jam packed too. During the week it's a pretty calm place where you can enjoy a nice game of pool, jenga, cornhole, or darts. There are also various arcade games available too. Trust me you will not run out of things to do while you're there!! On the weekends they tend to have a live dj and the party is pumpin' until the late night. Guaranteed to be a packed house but also guaranteed to be a good time! Be prepared to make new friends and have a great time! This is a staple of the neighborhood!!",4-star
"This bar is a great place. I have read all of the previous posts regarding it and I want to adress some of the negative comments and then give my positive feedback. 1st. Most of the people who say the staff are rude were kicked out because they lack common decency and etiquette. The staff are human beings. They have stress and real world issues too. So coming in and acting like you have no common sense or manners is just an agitation. However, coming in and completely disrespecting the staff and the establishment is unacceptable. People seem to forget that the people working in this industry are human. Not only do they make mistakes occasionally, but they also have thoughts and feelings too. So a little courtesy goes a long way. 2nd. It is one of the only establishments I know of who will cut people off for their own safety. Many people here have gotten mad for being kicked out; just as many have been mad about over-serving. Everyone metabolizes alcohol differently. It it's the bars discretion to determine if someone has had too much and if they need to go. Some people ""play"" sober better than others. If someone is cut off... they have gone above the call of duty to call cabs etc to take care of the people to intoxicated. 3rd. Tips. This is an industry based on tips. Some of the workers in bars make their money exclusively on tips. ""So get a better job"" is the most common response. To that I say this 1) most of these people have other jobs and need to supplement their income somehow. 2) ok if they all get ""better"" jobs, where will you drink? 3) if you want ""cheap"" drink prices, unlike Europe, keep costs low and the people employed! 4) in America, it is not only expected, but a common courtesy to tip the bar staff. 4th. Security. A lot of people take security for granted, but there are both legal and legitimate reasons for every security ""issue"". Just like the constant security changes at the airport due to threats and national security posture, so to, do bars need to adjust their security accordingly. Most people don't know or care about the bars and clubs robbed every day or the staff who are attacked. But the bar and staff know it too well! So if they tell you to do something or not to do something it is for their and your's safety. Which brings me to this. 90% of people have an excellent time here and it's because they are responsible adults going out looking for a good time. As long as you act like a decent human being and treat others as you want to be treated you too will have an excellent time. Soooo many regulars and soooo many new folk love this place because it really does give you everything...except food...which is fine because there are at least 6 other places to eat in this awesome nieghborhood!",5-star
I've always bar hopped in Noda. I live in Myers Park and my family members were visiting me so I decided to hit up Noda. We had tons of fun until we came to the Blind Pig. The bartenders and bouncers were rude. We weren't aloud to stand literally anywhere. We were a large group of women so obviously for safety reasons we don't wanna split up @ bars. I don't know if it's bc we were a large group of Latina women or what but it just seemed like we were not wanted there. This place should harbor an accepting atmosphere where we can happily get drinks and use the bathroom while waiting for one another. Sorry not sorry.,1-star
"Last night, I went to the Blind Pig and had a very disappointing experience. I was drinking a beer from a pint glass, when I found a large, thin shard of glass in it. This was very alarming because I could have easily swallowed this piece of glass and it would have definitely cut my throat and stomach. I went up to the bar and said to a bartender, ""I just found this shard of glass in my cup, is there a manager or the owner that I can talk to."" Her response was, ""oh that happens all the time."" And then pointed me over to a man, that I believe was the owner of the Blind Pig. When I went up to the owner and told/ showed him the same thing, he took the glass, threw it away, shrugged his shoulders, and kept working. I was completely shocked and disgusted at the owner and bartender's reaction. They did not seem to care that large shards of glass are in their pint glasses ""all the time."" Along with this obvious health issue, I am shocked at their customer service. I did not get any acknowledgement that this could be an issue and could be very dangerous. I expected at least an apology and some eye contact. If I ever do go here again, I will be buying my drink out of a bottle.",1-star
Pretty sweet bar! The place is spacious with fun games upstairs and a sweet spot outside for the smokers to enjoy. Staff is awesome!,5-star
"I came here with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. This place is so much fun! I don't know why I haven't been here before! There are all sorts of game, an arcade area, beer pong, battle shots (missing a boat!), corn hole, etc. it's a blast. The bartenders are friendly and helpful, specials are listed on a chalk board, I stuck to Shock top, so I don't know how the mixed drinks are. (I did have a jäger bomb that was delicious though...). There's also a digital board on the wall that you can send a text to - we announced the birthday, and tested some movie quotes. The crowd on Saturday was not particularly good at Wedding Crashers quotes. The back patio area got really crowded with smokers, which was kind of nice for our inside group. I'll definitely come back here for a fun night out.",5-star
"So I went there with a few friends on a Saturday night. It was pretty quiet overall. I went to the juke box to play music, the man in front of me said to go ahead and use the rest of his credits. I asked him if he was sure since my genre was difference then his, but he insisted. As I was selecting my songs (which were metal/Rock) another person there, walked up to me and asked which songs were mine because he didn't like the current songs playing. As I showed him my list, he's said good and he likes my selection. So I played 4 songs, this would have taken up 15 minutes of everyone's time. Before the second song ended, a worker (the owner) came over and played a ton of songs. When I checked my songs were no longer listed. So I confronted him, he removed my songs because he said it killed the atmosphere.. No one was even dancing.. So I told him to give me my money back. My friends then told me that's they noticed how everyone around seemed to actually enjoy my songs. But apparently it wasn't main stream enough for them..why have a jukebox with songs.. If you can't even play the music you want..",1-star
"Dear Blind Pig in the heart of NoDa, one of my favorite spots, I love you. Lets get married, run away and bring all the games with us : ) The Blind Pig is phenomenal, a dive bar atmosphere with snarky bartenders (funny, not rude) and lots of energy. Don't go here expecting a low key night. The place is always hopping and full of life... one of the many reasons I love it. Surrounded by games, there's no way to be bored at this place. Skee ball, giant jenga, twister, mini golf (one hole), darts, basketball game, Ms. Pac Man, Battle shots - yes, shots, not ship. First time I went actually my girlfriend and I decided to start at the Blind Pig at 8pm and bar hop throughout NoDa. And about 2 am we finally left the bar haha. Met some really chill guys, played 6 hours worth of games and had an amazing time. And the drinks - nicely priced and always a shot and a beer on special. Stick around long enough and you'll be able to sing karoake, grab a group for beer pong and probably meet some cool people. If you are new to the area, I'm sure you've been told to check out NoDa. And if you go to NoDa, you have to walk over to the Pig. One of my favorite bars in Charlotte and definitely worth a visit time and time again!",5-star
"I do love my dive bars and there is nothing quite like walking into a dive for the first time. I've worked at and been to plenty of dive bars in my life time so what makes The Blind Pig unique? Walk in the door and go to your left you will find a room full of fun and games! Skee ball (my fav) I promise you will not beat me at skee ball, but keep walking and you will find basketball, darts, pool, a punching bag and well of course a bar. Now take route number two and walk through the doors and down the steps. Maybe it was because it was Memorial Day weekend or a Friday night I don't know but this night there was a pretty rocking hippy dance-fest going on...one of the things I really enjoyed about this bar was the crowd it was very eclectic and brought all kinds of people together. Now after all the indoor games and dancing it was time to check out the back patio. I'm loving all the outdoor patios popping up in the QC and this place has one to brag about. Why? Huge outdoor space featuring you guessed it more games; connect four, twister, corn-hole, jenga (life size versions of your favorite board games)! No food but lots of entertainment and very friendly bartenders. A new favorite hang out hmm I think so!",4-star
"Excellent NoDa location that's worth the occassional visit! We played a few games of pool, few games of dart, and had a few rounds of beers. Great hang out spot with reasonable priced brews! Great place for a bar crawl stop!",4-star
"Love this place, who doesn't like to play games with theirs friends while drinking some beers? Thought it was a very clever dive bar!",5-star
"I loved this place. Cheap drinks, fun activities, and ridiculously friendly people. I liked the adult sized Jenga in the outdoor area and the random playground pig/horse things. Probably would stick with beer here. I didn't really care for the gimlet I ordered and my friend didn't finish her cheap vodka drink. I guess the house vodka is really cheap. But hey, it's a dive bar, that's what you get. It's too bad we were all tired and couldn't seem to muster up the energy to really enjoy everything.",4-star
Been here twice. First time was in April. Great bar in a great 'hood. I love the laid-back but quite a bit loud atmosphere (if that makes sense). I highly recommend. Also has a few arcade games.,5-star
"Kinda torn between a 3 and 4 star review here. The bar itself is kinda dank and dive-y but they also have a bunch of bar games to keep you entertained while you have a pint or two. May just be that its a old building is all. Anyways, the actual area for sitting in front of the bar is kinda on the small side so this isn't really a place that can accommodate that many people to begin with. Plenty of TV's in here though to watch a football game on but they do seem to be a little high up so it's almost like you are sitting front row center at the movie theater. If you are with a group of friends looking to play some pool this is probably the best spot in Noda. Otherwise you may just want to check out another one of the choice bars/restaurants.",3-star
"I went down to Noda for a meetup group at Growler's Pourhouse, and ended up stumbling my way down to the blind pig with a group of new friends. I love dive bars, and could pretty much tell through my beer goggles that it'd be love at first site for me and The Blind Pig. She enticed me with her diveyness and once I walked in, there was a box of body parts sitting there waiting for me. Not just any body parts, but Mr and Mrs Potato Head parts. OH MY GOD!!! I sat there for about 10 minutes or maybe 40, not really sure since it was drunken bar time. Who cares, I made so many Potato Head masterpieces that I was not moving anytime soon. Once my creative muse was finally stifled, I ventured through the rest of the bar, chatted with some people who I made into new friends whether they liked it or not and dragged them all outside with me to the adult playground that was waiting for me!!! Thankfully I was a bit intoxicated or I would have fallen to my knees and wept from the site in front of me... Adult sized connect four? Giant lumber blocks for Jenga?? Twister? Spring Toys and Corn Hole???? ARE YOU SERIOUS???? Oh, it was ON!! High Heels and all, I ran to that metal pig sitting on it's spring and reverted back to child hood. I had an amazing time at this place and it if were a little closer to my place I'd frequent it often. Next time though, I'd probably snag a potato head to ride the metal pig with me!! WEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!",5-star
"basketball, skeeball, beer pong, touch tunes, cigarettes, silver strike bowling, ATM, bathrooms, beer, patio, boxing machine,TVs, billiard/pool tables, and darts! pretty much everything you could ask for at a bar. a dozen or so taps which include some local stuff, had NoDa Brewing available when I was there. atmosphere didn't feel quite the same as the rest of NoDa but it's new and still getting its own identity. was also earlier in the evening and only stayed for a couple beers but really enjoyed what i saw and the potential.",5-star
I live in NoDa and think The Blind Pig is a nice upscale addition to the neighborhood. It has a really nice game room which is separate from the rest of the bar which makes it pretty unique. They also had a lot of craft beer on tap which is always going to draw me in. I hated to see more galleries leave but this is a nice addition to NoDa.,5-star
"Just a tourist stopping for a good meal. The place didn't disappoint! Totally recommend! Great food, Great atmosphere. Indoor/outdoor seating for a casual experience",5-star
This is a hidden gem in Nevada. One of the best burgers in Nevada. The staff is always friendly and the food is amazing. Well worth the visit. I recommend the Dillinger burger.,5-star
Great food the Dillinger and the sweet potato fries was it!! Stopped by on the way back from the hover dam while in town for SEMA. Definitely one of our favorite meals since we've gotten out here including places we've ate on the strip. Great place friendly people!,5-star
Everything we have ever had there has been fantastic. The food it made fresh to order. Our family went there on a Weekday and it was no only not as crowded but the chatter wasn't as loud as usual. Great service each time we go. Happy as they kept our Sodas full.,5-star
"Every time that I come in to town my family comes here. Usually the service is great! However, this time, not so much. The servers were not engaged in helping our party and hardly checked in on us. The manager (I think) came by to see how things were going but it had been foreverrrrr since we ordered and nothing came if his visit. If this place is going to continue to be a go-to place for me and my family, they need to step up their service. Get some servers who want to make the customer HAPPY!! I hope that this review helps management take notice of the poor quality of service and make some changes so that when I come back everything is back to the way it was...",2-star
"This is one of my go to restaurants in Boulder City. Everything is always delicious, but I recommend the chopped salad and Baby Face Nelson burger with a side of sweet potato French fries. I get them almost every time. I like that I can choose indoor or outdoor dining and that dogs are allowed outside. The outside has misters and heaters, so it is open all year. The service is always excellent and the manager usually stops by the table to make sure that everything is good. Make sure you check out the tropical salt scrub in the bathroom. It smells amazing and is a really nice touch.",5-star

"We were all famished after a trip to hoover dam. We scheduled a helicopter flight and the people there recommended dillingers. It met and exceeded our hopes. We all got a different burger and all 4 were cooked to perfection and very good. Service was good, we sat outside, and also very much enjoyed the pets allowed. The water bowls scattered around were a nice welcome to a pet friendly restaurant!!",5-star
"An amazing burger joint. Had the Brie and Jam burger, never even seen that type of burger before. was really good. Beer was amazing. chill spot.",4-star
Nice atmosphere. Restaurant is in a cool little historic part of Boulder City. Wife had Philly steak sandwich. It was good. I had the executioner burger. Great! Side of sweet potato fries also great. Nice beers on tap. Would definitely go back. Great option to break away from crazy Vegas strip or as part of a day trip to Hoover dam like us.,5-star
"The Dillinger is a great spot that my boyfriend and I used to love to go to when we wanted to get out of Vegas for the afternoon. Great veggie burger, a unique, relaxed vibe that is hard to find in Vegas, good beer selection, friendly staff. Well worth the short drive out to Boulder City to check out. I'm really torn up about this, but I don't think I'll be coming back here after our last experience. When we arrived the place was pretty full. Saturday evening, to be expected. An older white haired, heavy set guy (manager? owner? host?) tells us there's only seats available at the bar or outside on the patio. I glance at an open table next to him and he explains that he wants to save the 6-top in case a large group comes in. I'm not a fan of sitting at the bar I tell him, I prefer a table, but no worries, we sat outside, they had misters, it was fine. Our server was absolutely delightful, a young guy with an infectious smile, super friendly, we both loved him. Everything was perfect, food came out and it was great, we were enjoying our meal as usual until the band started up. I should have noticed the band set up before we sat down, but I didn't think anything of it. I have a hard time with loud noises and this was WAY too loud for my comfort. I sat with it for a few songs until it became too much for me. I asked the white haired guy from before if we could be moved inside. There's only seats at the bar, he tells me. I tell him no thanks, I take my last few more bites of my veggie burger and go inside to ask our sever for our check and use the restroom. That's when I see three open tables there. I was just floored that this guy would lie right to my face and tell me there are no tables. Two of the three were set, too, one was that 6-top that hadn't been seated since we came in. I look at the tables, look at him, and shake my head in disgust. I have never felt so worthless as a customer. If this was some random spot I'd never been to before, I'd have written it off and not cared so much, but The Dillinger really was one of my favorite places, and I can't go back there if this white haired guy will be there. Seriously heartbroken. You won, white haired guy. You will never have to waste a table on me again. Three stars because this is a really, really awesome (5 star) place to check out except for one really really horrible person there who has ruined it for me. :-/ Shoot me a message if he ever leaves, I'll go back with bells on.",3-star
"A surprising little gem in downtown Boulder City, The Dillinger boasts good service with very good food. The steak salad I ordered was worth the wait and the beer selection was fairly impressive. Kudos to the restaurant, too, for their honesty and followthrough. I left my credit card there after paying for my to-go order. Realizing it the next morning, I called the restaurant and the voice on the other end confirmed they still had my card. Since I didn't live in the area they were kind enough to drop it in the mail and send it off to me to save me the 1 1/2 round trip drive to swing by and grab it. This place has earned my return business.",5-star
"Fantastic choice of burgers, and all of them delicious (And I've actually tried them all- admittedly the PB was not my favorite, but still yummy.)Staff is always friendly, even when they're busy on weekend nights with live music. The owner is always there, helpful, and making sure the customer is having a great experience. It's my personal favorite of the restaurant/bar options in town, and the one I take my friends to.",5-star
"Get an appetizer order of chicken wings Dillinger style and thank me later. This place is great! You really can't go wrong with most of the items, if not all, on the menu. Perfectly cooked and portioned every time. Flavor is never missing even on the most plain items! A Boulder City must have.",5-star
This place is a cool spot to hang out and enjoy live music. You can tell they had their regulars and mostly everyone seemed to know each other. We tried one of their special drinks that was in a small barrel in the back of the bar. I don't remember the name but it was pretty strong but smooth.,4-star
"Service was descent. No complaints there. Macaroni cheese bite appetizer (had 1 time before) was yummy. As for the burgers, both were overcooked and not that good. 45 special well done burger was almost burnt. Medium Bugsy burger was medium well to almost well. Prices are a bit higher than on the website but still not bad.",3-star
"While traveling through Boulder City, we stopped to have lunch 7/15/15. We were more than surprised with the quality of food and drink. Since this was a Wednesday, my husband had $1.00 draft beer. Our sandwiches were large and we could have shared our plates. Seasoned french fries were some of the best we have ever tasted. I had a glass of White Sangria. The owner even shared her recipe for the Sangria. Best service we have had in a long time. We highly recommended this place to our friends and family who live in Las Vegas. We will be a repeat customer next time we are in Boulder City. NV.",5-star
"Our motel's front desk suggested this place. I should not have listened and will let them know. We had terrible service, apparently due to our being from out of town. We waited forever to order our food while our waitress gave extra attention to others including one particular table, apparently locals. I noticed similar treatment of others who appeared to be tourists. When we asked for service, we got attitude and little help. When the appetizer finally arrived, it was just dropped on the table. I'm sorry that I left any tip at all. No accommodation of any kind was made or offered. The food is pretty good but certainly not worth the bad service and crazy wait for the food to arrive. The host was nice and helpful, however that couldn't save a dismal experience. Skip this place and try one of the other more interesting spots in this quaint part of town with what I am sure is much better service to all guests. Several days after posting this review, ""Grant T. of the Dillinger,"" who I assume is the owner, posted a comment. Interestingly, he did everything but apologize for the poor attitude of and terrible service provided by our waitress and the fact that she spent the majority of the time we were there serving one particular table for which she clearly had an affinity while at the same time virtually ignoring our table. After waiting and waiting, we were able to order only after I asked the host to get her attention, so that we could order. Instead of casting unwarranted aspersions at guests who receive unsatisfactory customer service, I suggest that he apologize for the poor experience and commit to improving service at his establishment. By the way, the food was good, not great, and the ambience is much closer to lackluster than outstanding. The only productive aspect of Grant T.'s comment was to remind me that I should do a better job of remembering to post positive reviews of restaurants where I have a good experience. Interestingly, the very next morning, my daughters and I had breakfast at the Southwest Diner in Boulder City. The food and the service were nothing short of amazing and worthy of a 5-star rating, which I will now post. Be sure to check that place out the next time you're in Boulder City.",1-star
"This place is solid for a quick, no-frills bite before/after checking out the Hoover Dam. They're known for their burgers so I got a plain one with blue cheese. They have a lot of different options/toppings but sometimes a burger with nothing on it is so satisfying. This is a good burger. Generous in size and delicious in flavor. For an extra $1 you can upgrade to sweet potato fries which were decent.",4-star
"3 stars for good food & cheap drinks, plus 1 more star for great service! -onion rings were yum! -Chinese chicken salad was good & big enough for 2 -friendly & attentive servers -comfortable atmosphere I live in Las Vegas and came out here for the live music.

"Best burgers in Vegas hands down! Actually the restaurant is in Boulder city about 20-30 minutes from the strip but it is definitely worth the trip! We came on a Sunday afternoon and everything was delicious. The restaurant is an old bank and has a lot of charm. It still looks like a bank and the outside has shotguns for door handles (great photo op). It is small inside but wasn't too busy. Our server was great and very attentive. The burgers have fun bank robber names and interesting toppings. Some have Asian slaw, brisket on top of a burger, and a fried egg. I ordered The Capone which comes with jack and cheddar cheese, grilled onions, smoked applewood bacon and special sauce. My friend ordered The Dillinger which is a burger topped with applewood smoked bacon and beef brisket. We both got a side of the sweet potato fries. Both burgers were amazing and so filling! Prices were great especially for the potion size (ranged from $8-$18 depending on what you order). Definitely make the trip out to Boulder City to try this hidden gem!",5-star
Did the Dillinger for lunch.... Very kool place to have a good burger. The feel and atmosphere were excellent and the burgers are well made. If your close drop in you won't be disappointed.,4-star

"Great to eat there and pick up to go. I usually place large orders when I take groups to tour Hoover Dam. They make the best sandwiches in town. Even the vegetarian sandwich is amazing. I call a couple of weeks in advance for my large orders. Dan, Cindy, and the staff are always great and prepare everything on time.",5-star

"Fantastic burgers. I got ""the copone"" (the messy one) it was great! fries are so-so. The atmosphere is definitely small town feel, but its in a nice neighborhood so you don't feel like you are too far off the beaten path. A place where the older crowd likes to hang out. It wasn't too busy or too quiet when we ate there. Overall a great experience. The burger definitely made it worth the try.",5-star

"Had never actually been into downtown Boulder City, so I went down on a recent Saturday into the downtown area to see what it was all about. After stopping into several of the local businesses we kept getting great reviews from the locals about The Dillinger. This place is the type of small restaurant and bar that I absolutely love. The server and bar staff were really welcoming when we came in for lunch. They have a fairly small menu focused mainly on the burgers. And I have to say they are exceptional. I wouldn't say its close to the best burger I've ever had but it's definitely up there. My wife had The Dillinger which is the namesake burger. It's topped with applewood smoked bacon, slow cooked beef brisket, and cheddar cheese. It all meshes so well it should be illegal. Dillinger would be proud....It was AMAZING! I really wasn't expecting how good it would be. And for the food challenge lover they have the Widow maker which is a Double Dillinger, which someone ate while we were there (albeit with a knife and fork???) I went with the Baby Face Nelson which is basically a Caprese salad with fig spread on top of a burger. It was really good, but just doesn't compare to The Dillinger. The also have an AMAZING beer selection, with a ton of smaller craft breweries on draft and bottle. For me it was a great day because it was the first time I had ever had the Dogfish head 75 minute IPA on a suggestion from our server. They have a total of 9 different Dogfish options on draft and bottle and several others from Rogue, Big Dog's, etc. But they also get down and dirty with the PBR for those who are looking for a cheaper selection. And on Wednesday they are only $1. The beer was $15 which is the going rate everywhere in town (25oz bottle) The Dillinger was $11 and The Baby Face was $12.50. This was exceptionally reasonable for a quality hand crafted burger. Along with it we got both types of fries of which, of the 2, the sweet potato fries were the easy winner. After walking around all of Boulder City that day, I found nothing else that even compares to this place without heading into Vegas. If you find yourself in Boulder City you have to check this place out.",5-star

"My boyfriend and I went to Boulder City for a little ""Leaving Las Vegas""-style bender/staycation. We got a room at the El Rancho motel, then stumbled down the road to drink the nite away at the succession of quaint little bars lining Main Street. Alas, before we had even cultivated a stagger, the whole damn town started shuttering up! Bar after bar turned us away, like Joseph and Mary trying to find a room at the inn...until FINALLY, a shining star appeared in the east: Dillinger! Thank christ this genteel establishment stays open late enough to cater to us debauched types. The place was packed with some kind of hipster bachelor party, plus one or two locals and a guy with a mic and a guitar playing rock covers. The bartendress had a very heavy hand, and the drinks were stiff and well priced. I can't speak to the food, since this was an alcoholic bender staycation, and real alkies don't need solid nourishment other than olives and limes. But the atmo and drinks were great, and they let us stay until around midnight...considerably later than all those lame-ass bars on Main St. Kudos to you, Dillinger.",5-star
"Definitely the best patio and Markham Main Street, and possibly even the best patio in town. The reason why is because they give you a choice of front patio which is good for people watching and holding the setting sun as it faces West, or the eastern side patio which is away from the noise and smells of the street and is like a very adorable large oasis, ringed with trees 30 to 40 feet tall on all sides. The food is great but not perfect, and just one star taking off for one bad day we were there for a very very busy open micHosted by our incredible multitalented super busy friend Kevin Kerr, and even though the place was absolutely packed they had only one waitress who had to cover the entire restaurant, so points taken off the management for that, we know that you pay waitresses very very little the least you can do is try to over staff rather than under staff. Friends of mine were visiting from downtown and they waited over an hour to even get their food order in and finally just gave up and left.",4-star
"Bad service, worse food. The wings seem to get good reviews I'd advise sticking to them if you have to eat here. Ordered the fish and chips which seemed like a safe bet for a pub. The batter was incredibly thick and undercooked. Spongey on the outside and wet inside, almost like a paste. The fish was definitely frozen before but smelled and tasted off. I ate one bite and couldn't continue. My girlfriend had the chicken club which she said was alright but dry and bland. Hard to mess up a club sandwich. The waitress noticed I wasn't eating my meal, asked if it was gross which I confirmed but it was still on the bill. No discount, no further acknowledgment at all. Would not return.",1-star
"A typical pub. It can get pretty busy on weekend nights, especially upstairs. Came here last Saturday for lunch. They only had a bartender working, no server. Server showed up when we were paying. I ordered a roast beef dip. Pretty bland and unimpressive. I won't be coming back here for food.",2-star
"Have been coming to the Duchess for many years - they're an institution here in Markham, and have been for almost 2 decades. They serve traditional pub fare, but have some things that are uniquely theirs - my personal favourites are their Irish nachos (nachos made with cactus cut fries instead of tortilla chips), onion chips, and of course their wings. But the best thing by far is the community - you're bound to see family and friends at the Duchess, and the friendly staff make you feel at home. Check out live music there too three times a week!",5-star
Been there twice before. The first time was a random Wednesday I had off in the summer. Me and a buddy went around 2 and it was packed which surprised us. It was definitely an older crowd who seemed to be locals/regulars for the most part. We ordered wings and beer and the service was fast and the wings were delicous. Went there again yesterday night and the wings were 50% off. Our bill for the wings and beer betwen the both of us that we had only rang in at under $29 including tax and tip. Amazing wings and great value. It's a great local gem,5-star
"Came here last Saturday for lunch. The restaurant is big with several TVs showing sporting events. There's a nice size patio in the back with a fully operational bar. On this Saturday, they had 3 specials happening. A breakfast special, a lunch special (I think it was a wrap) and a wings special. I decided on the wings special and they were decent. Typical wing sauce choices. The wings were deep fried but not breaded, surprisingly, they weren't dry at all! There were a decent amount of wings for it's price, great value! As I was leaving, I noticed there was a 2nd floor to this restaurant so I went up to check it out. There was a big screen TV and more tables. The server said they open it everyday at 4pm. Looks like a good spot to watch sporting events! To end, food was decent and service was good.",4-star
"Attended with the Mrs. for Tuesday wing night. We were seated very quickly, a great deal for wings. Served with fries or the option of onion chip, which are great. Wings are a bit small, however have a healthy portion. The wings were a bit dry (hot flavour) but got a side of suicide sauce and comes with a great dill dip. Overall a great night, and a great deal, not to be missed if you are in Markham.",4-star
YUM. I came here last Friday night with my boyfriend and we both left happy and full. My boyfriend got the wings + fries. I ate half of his wings and half of his fries. They were sooo good. The wings were on the small side ]: The fries were delicious - crispy and fresh. They have wings night here on Tuesday & Wednesday. I got the steak but I only ate a quarter of it as I was filled from the wings. The steak was annihilated the next day at home. Will definitely be back next Tuesday or Wednesday for Wings night!,4-star
"Went to this place recently for a birthday Have to say it was a surprise Usually pub food isn't that good However, when I ate there tonight the food was quite good Ordered the Irish nachos A nice spicy kick to them Ordered the steak wrap Was quite yummy and tasty Had it with the dill sauce and it hit the spot Menu was big and had a lot of variety Not a bad overall",4-star
"I stopped here after seeing The Force Awakens. This is a decent pub, the tap list is good and the food on the menu was varied and interesting. The guy who came and served us seemed a little odd, but he was pretty nice. I had a Monte Cristo Sandwhich for the first time ever, and a barking squirrel. The Monte Cristo Sandwich wasn't really for me. But that wasn't the pub's fault. It's just not a sandwich for me. However, I would like to try other things that they make. I would probably go back here again in the future.",4-star
"I had to review this place after reading the joke review from two weeks ago. The duchess is not only the best bar in east Markham, it's also the friendliest and safest. The previous review makes it seem like a dangerous place which is the furthest thing from reality. They have by far the best and biggest beer selection in Markham. A good mix of craft, European, and standard domestics. They also have some of the best wings around. All the bartenders are great, along with the wait staff.",5-star
"My friends and I came here for a late night pitcher of Heineken and a dozen of wings and some fries for about $30. Many people come to the dutchess to relax after a long day of work. Wings were delicious. There was a stage that was open for performances which I thought was really cute as people of all ages went up to sing a song or songs of their choice. There were some talented songwriters as well, who decided to perform for their very first time. I could tell there's a lot of regulars, but if you want to come out and relax, Duchess is a great place.",3-star
It is what it is. It's a Markham Main Street staple that ranges from being more like a boring restaurant in the winter to pure amazingness in the summer. It has a great patio out back. Food is typical average pub fair and the beers do the job. Always a large number of regulars inside and seems to be a good local hangout for returning university students. I've always had a good time here.,4-star
One of the best pubs around. The wings are truly amazing and bring me back time and time again. The selection of beers is good and they keep adding new brews on a regular basis to keep it interesting but what really makes this place is the staff who go out of their way to make you feel welcome. Lot's of regulars here and the crowd ranges from University age and up so the mix is always inclusive. Live music on the weekends and in the summer the front and back patio's are great options.,5-star
"Come here EVERY Tuesday for family wing night! FOOD - I'm not so sure about the regular menu because I only go there on Tuesdays for wing night but the wings are awesome for their price! They come on a bed of thick cut fries that are crisp and golden on the outside and soft in the inside. I pay less than $10 for a ""small"" basket of wings, a bed of fries and their amazing house creamy-dill dipping sauce, and an iced tea. It's a great deal for a late night snack or even a regular dinner. SERVICE - The service is great. Our waitress is always friendly, ALWAYS smiling and checks up on us from time to time to see how our food is. Never had bad service. The atmosphere is great. A cozy sports bar with a room full of people where literally, everyone knows everyone. Some may say it is crowded but I personally love the fact it is. Gives it a great ""home"" feel. Overall, I would suggest coming here with a group of friends to watch the big game or to just chat.",4-star
"Have been going here for about 8 years. Usually will deserve 5 stars with quality of servers and food, but this time was served by Julia (tall girl) on the patio and had one of the worst experiences ever. She needs to go or step it up! Never been so poorly served since I can remember in any establishment. To make an order had to literally ask one of the more responsible waitresses to get her. Seated at 8:00pm, got to make an order at 8:30pm (she literally never once stopped by for 30 minutes). When making the order for wings, requested they be made extra spicey. For some reason s he understood that meant extra saucey, which was inedible. It was literally sauce with wings on the side. Sent them back and never got an edible meal until 9:20pm. To kill time I had to order more beers. Throughout the whole process, she was unapologetic and still inattentive. As long as she serves an area I sit in, I won't be eating at duchess. It's disappointing because the waitresses there usually provide a much better experience. This experience is a testament that a good waitress really does improve the experience...",1-star
"Haven't been for almost 20 years, what a disappointment, the waitress was completely zoned out, food was microwaved steak and kidney pie. Told waitress it was the worst pie I ever had, she did take it off the bill, but did not ask if I wanted something different. Will not return....",1-star
Best pub and oldest pub in Markham! I heard they even have ghost or two lurking in the upstairs part. Best wings in town. Guiness always fresh and cold.,5-star
"This is the best pub in Markham Village. The wings are fantastic, there's a good selection of beer on tap, and the other pub fare is great. The service is also very good. Some of the other reviews have noted that it's a small pub, but there's a second floor, and in the summer there is a HUGE patio out back. This might not be obvious if you were just dropping in. The atmosphere in the summer on the patio is great. All in all, it's a good pub experience that's been a local favourite since 1980.",5-star
"This quaint little establishment right in the middle of main street has everything that a pub should have. It is a little on the small side but with the second floor and the backyard patio, it keeps it patrons happy. Some friends who are regulars here recommended this place and I have to say, they were right to recommend it. It is very friendly and the food is very tasty. They go that little extra step to do what they can to make you happy which is the entire point of eating out in the first place. If you are in the area and looking for a pint or some nice wings, stop on by.",4-star
"I was surprised how tiny this place it... from the outside it looks like a house but when you get in it's quite small. I didn't really enjoy myself here tonight JUST because I had one of these ""OMG!"" girls next to my table and she seriously wouldnt shut up for 2 seconds... talk talk talk talk talk ....and all about stupid stuff on top of it ... ANYWAYS... I think this pub needs a makeover... it's not very cozy and the bar part is very cramped... they need to open that part up. There is an upstairs part where I think there were pool tables and darts. They have entertainement from Thurs-Sunday. The guys tonight weren't bad they did a lot of old rock songs however Im sure the bands are mixed up. I found it very loud when they started the play... I think they need a bigger place in order to have entertainment like that. I'd say this place is only good for a quick drink and then head outta there...",2-star
"Easily among the best wings in the city, the dill sauce is the best in the city (it's worth it, trust me) and the beer is reasonably priced. The rest of the menu is decent pub grub, but go for the wings. The place is small, but the upstairs has extra sitting with a nice projection screen, a second bar and dart boards. While I've watched lots and lots of hockey games there, sometime during the third period a band will often come in and make it impossible to talk at your table.",5-star
"The food was above average for a bar but service is too casual! Drinks well made thanks for real Clamato juice chilled, for a real good Caesar drink! Fox salad good but over priced and Guinness pot pie very nice meat could be more tender at that price. Staff friendly yet waitress seems more like someone just filling in! The waiter ""knowing"" is lacking ie: finger food serve wetnaps, remove dishes between courses! Waited around a while for things needed & ended up getting up and serving myself for things we needed to eat comfortably! Bathroom horrendous! A tough call if I'd go back a balance of: cleanliness, menu, food quality and taste, service and the compassion of a waiter is hard to find! If anyone finds it I'd be a loyal customer!",3-star
"Tamar at the Fox and the Fiddle on Danforth is the best, cutest, most proficient and friendly server I have met in many years. The Fox has always been one of my favourite spots to frequent....however since Tamar has been my server I am hooked. The Fox is the place for us all. Let's put dollar bills in this most deserving servers pocket...request her has your server and you will be well taken care of. Thank you Fox and thank you Tamar. Your best customer Christine.",5-star
"Is it a dive-y sports bar? Yes. Is it the best dive-y sports bar on the Danforth? YES!!! It's relaxed, not pretentious, and a genuinely friendly place. Great beer on tap, from macros to micros (their rotating tap is currently Cameron's Cream Ale), TV's for every game, and good ol' pub grub. Terry has been there for over 19 years and you can't ask for a friendlier publican. Many of the posters here seem to think that every place on the Danforth has to be special or fancy. As a local, it's nice to have a place I can wear a t-shirt and comfy jeans and enjoy ""my"" pub.",4-star
"DO NOT GO HERE. Go any place on the Danforth but here. In a nutshell: Overpriced; Stingy food portions; Inattentive service; Dingy, smelly washrooms. Awful. Just awful.",1-star
"If you'd like to Fiddle with this Fox, this isn't the place to come. I won't be here! I don't really drink, and when I do I don't like being overcharged, and this place does. Having said that, it's on The Danforth so I expect it. I haven't eaten here, but our drinks were fine, service was good, cokes, Labbatts, Molson, everything went down well. Nice little atmosphere and this place really dominates The Danforth as the main pub along the Greektown street, so if you want to go drinking in these parts, this would be a good place to start. Plus it's named after me.",3-star
"Always good food, table TV for those Blue Jay games! A very comfortable pub, the staff is always caring, and accommodating. Brunch on both Saturday and Sunday. I have never had a bad experience in all of my visits. And there have been many.",4-star
"Needed a place with TVs to watch the Raptors game so we decided to come here. There are many TVs, lots of speakers and projectors as well. Great for large groups too. This is my first time here so I wasn't sure what to expect so we started off with the calamari. And this is BY FAR THE WORST CALAMARI WE'VE EVERRR TASTED. Couldn't even finish it! There was ZERO taste so I had to a lot of salt and black pepper (and I'm pretty anti salt so that should tell you something). For my main meal I got the veggie nachos which were actually really good. I liked that it was real marble cheese and not that cheese whiz gross crap that a lot of other places use on their nachos. I was preparing for the worst since the calamari was so nasty. My boyfriend got the beef burger with fries which he also liked. The fries tasted homemade which is always a bonus. As for our waitress, she wasn't too attentive but the restaurant was pretty packed so I didn't mind too much. Although we never formally complained, when she asked how the calamari was my boyfriend said it wasn't good. So she did discount the calamari 50% which was appreciated. I probably would come here again but not as my first option. Every restaurant I go to I always start off with calamari as my appetizer but DEFINITELY NOT HERE EVER AGAIN. I loved the atmosphere which had a large part to do with all the Raptors fans in here cheering on our city. I gave three stars because of the calamari, the inattentive waitress and my boyfriend's beer was pretty flat.",3-star
"No service, then a non reassuring visit from staff and no drinks even though it's been 15 minutes. Why have a place this large if you do not have a system to accommodate. We ordered food but if drinks have not arrived in 15 minutes ...did they even get the food order? Wow!",1-star
"Service is slow, food is sub par. Ok for nachos but I wouldn't recommend anything else. Given you're on the Danforth there are many better places one can go. Bloody Caesars are disgusting. I wouldn't recommend.",2-star
"I came here with my boyfriend for a drink and some apps on a Friday around 8pm. The food was awful - the wings tasted freezer burnt, calamari was bland, and the server didn't even check in to see if we were satisfied. I also had a Caesar as my beverage of choice and the rim was some sort of powdered celery salt. Yuck. Brutal service and terrible food. Need I say more?",1-star
"Staff are great and everyone is very friendly! Good place to hang out. They receive their meat order every Wed. So if you want quality and very fresh liver, Thursday is the day! Great experience.",4-star
"I enjoy it here. Great food and good drinks. The staff are friendly, I had the waitress Tianna and she was great. Reasonably priced for the danforth. It's worth trying out if you're in the area.",5-star
all i have to say is that the guy with glasses and dreads server guy is the chillest guy ever i love it ^_^ !! thanks for your positive vibes man. I'm on macros so I cant eat most of the yumy burgers on the menu but it's nice to get a little drink from here ^_^,5-star
"I came here for paint nite with a girlfriend and we both agreed the food here isn't that great. This is more like a last resort when everything else is closed. Honestly do not come here for food, the sangria is the only thing worth having and that is stretching it.... We had the spinach, cheese dip was very small for $13. It was half a cup and over cooked. The pita bread was burnt. The kettle cooked chips were very oily and not very tray. The dips were ok but weak flavor. Overall this is a a last ditch effort. Paint nite needs to pick better place that the food isn't horrible.",2-star
"Was here thanksgiving weekend. Horrible food, service, atmosphere . Even the door guy was insulting . I reserved a table for my friends and family but apparently it didn't matter because the game was on so no one had a place to sit as a group .My food was horrible and pretty much everyone of our bills were off! Never again!",1-star
The food was ok. They over charged an item on my bill. Lucky I was paying attention. They removed the incorrect charge and instead of removing the $1 they charged me for the mayonnaise ( a good customer service gesture) they did not. I will not go back.,2-star
"I ordered the quesadillas and the waitress asked me whether I'd like some guacamole. I replied yes but when the bill arrived I found out that I was charged an extra $1.54 without being informed about it! At the same time my friend asked for a side of mayo for her burger and they charged her $.99 for it!!! To top it off, her burger bun was stale and they also overcharged her for the burger. While the menu price was $12.99, the bill said $15. The waitress corrected it after she got notified about it. However I won't go again to a place that charges extra dollars here and there without informing the customers. This is a sneaky and a horrible up-selling technique. Their food is mediocre and it doesn't worth the money.",1-star
"I had eaten dinner in the area with a friend and we decided to drop by to have a drink and catch the end of a Jays game. From the outside this place seemed like a normal Pub, but on entering we were greeted by very hostile low class bouncers. There was obviously something about us that rubbed them the wrong way as they were very rude towards us from the get go. I've never experienced anything like that before, and I've been to some pretty sketchy places in my younger days. Bottom line, if you're someone who is using Yelp and can read complete sentences, this is most definitely not the place for you.",1-star
... I ordered the fox special drink and there was at least about 6 bugs dead just floating in my drink and some were frozen in the ice..... Disgusting!! but otherwise customer service friendly.,1-star
"I go here quite a bit the food is mediocre as are the drinks. I have often had to return drinks due to the glasses stinking or the orange tasting really off in my screwdriver. I love the patio and that's the only real reason I return, The service is either really good or really bad!",3-star
"Half decent brunch. Good service. But my last three visits I have had to ask for replacement drinks as they seem to have a chronic problem of flat beer coming from their taps. I came back on a Sunday morning in hopes of eggs benny. Instead, I was offered a refill on my coffee (one) and a 45 minute wait while server after server brought food to the large groups of people watching the soccer game...some of which arrived well after I did. As I said...45 minutes. At which time I walked out. Soccer games are scheduled months in advance, it isn't unreasonable to schedule adequate staff to serve your patrons. I realize that this review will do nothing...the place is always full and it is quite a shame because there are at least two or three pubs within walking distance...I guess they just do better service for large groups.",1-star
"I have been there many times, but no more, they have horrible customer service and business tactics, they use to charge $5.00 of UFC nights ( fight nights ) and they would have no room, no seats and no where to stand, where ever we stood, we were blocking someone's view, so decided to leave but they would not refund the cover charge for 4 people so that's $20 just wasted, then we drove from TO to Etobicke to watch the fights also the place is nothing special, been there many times for drinks and snacks",1-star
"Taste of Danforth, Iriana and I met up with my brother in what I consider the most NON-GREEK setting during the Taste of Danforth lol!! After Astoria we decided to walk around and eventually make our way to FNF!! The place was packed!!!! but thankfully there was not a lineup! the staff seemed a bit pretentiously overwhelmed, but again it was a street festival. Looking at their drink menu we both came to a conclusion to have SANGRIA, one RED and WHITE!!!!! In the past most sangrias served at bars tend to be watered down, but this place really packed a punch!! I like a strong sangria!! and the fruits actually taste fermented! which is a KEY COMPONENT in my books, the longer the better ;) Overall they have a big patio and the service was fast considering the place was at capacity.",2-star
"The bald security guard is a real piece of work. Came here with a group of friends, he of course ID'd us at the door then proceeded to walk over to our table once we got comfortable and accused us of being drunk. We didn't even have one drink.",1-star
"Looking for a patio to sit at along the Danforth and found this place. First we saw 3 different waitresses in 5min all asking if we knew what drinks we wanted. After telling the first one we needed a moment, was slightly annoying to see a 2nd and a 3rd asking the same. My friend was in the ""middle"" of the patio so people (including the waitresses) kept on pushing her seat to go through. Also, waitresses did not take the menu back until about 2 hours after we were there. Drinks were ok. Food was awful. I got the cheese burger and my friend the fox banquet burger. Buns were dry (after 10min they were actually becoming hard), patties were really not good. My friend's bacon was really overcooked. My salad was better than my burger so it says a lot about the food. Sure it's a pub but I have been to many pubs with food much better than this! If you're here to watch a game, it's neat i guess with all the screens and even a private screen for every booth. Other than that, no.",2-star
"Ambiance: Its a SPOOORTS Bar with lots of huge screens and a lot of ambient noise. Beers: Decent number on tap but nothing special Service: Really hit or miss, depending on who is working and how busy they are.",2-star
"A friend of mine wanted to go to a quieter place on the Danforth for some social drinking and such. We stumbled across the fiddle later on and given the other franchises in the city we decided to give it a shot. The atmosphere is actually nice and pleasant compared to the other bars bearing the same name. Browsing the menu we found that the prices were a little higher than expected (on par with mid-range restaurants) and ordered our drinks and some of their ""Ultimate Fiddle Fries"". We received our drinks promptly but waited about 40 minutes for the food to arrive. The dish itself was presented well, but the ancho chili sauce was of poor quality and its bitterness ruined the flavor of the fresh cheese, jalapeno, tomatoes and sweet peppers. Let's just say, we did not finish the plate... Recommendations: -Stick to the beers here, and you will never be disappointed Warnings: -Stay away from the food -No Interac/Debit (though there is a price gouging atm)",2-star
This place has horrible service. We went there on a Sunday night and they sent us away because one of us didn't have any ID. We walked home to get her ID and when we got back he told us to leave because we could get charged for trespassing cause she wasn't minding her manners. All she did was toss her ID on the bar and it bounced and he took that as being rude and freaked on his power trip and told us to leave...maybe this is why the bar is TOTALLY dead. What a douche.,1-star
A decent enough place to sit outside and have a beer. The service was good and the food was about average for bar food in the area.,3-star
"This place is garbage. 1. Every time I wanted a new beer, I had to basically perform semaphore signals with my beer glasses like I was trying to guide a landing jumbo jet. 2. The fish and chips took forever to come out. I could have gone fishing, cleaned the fish, make a fire, and cook it faster than them. Seriously, why does deep frying some food take 1 hour? 3. The fish and chips had 2 pieces, I ate the first piece, then when I went to tackle the 2nd piece, there was a super long hair coiled underneath the piece like a snake waiting to strike. Shocked, I sent it back. 4. They charged 10 bucks a head to see the UFC fight and over packed the place causing everyone to be shoulder to shoulder and the root of the shitty overall service.",1-star
The Dane is a regular brunch or dinner place for us. Especially in the summer. We love that we never have to wait to be seated and the food is always the same reliable standard! I only recently tried the curried mussels and loved it! And my three year old son just sits down and asks for his Mac and cheese because he's obsessed with it. His dad follows suit half the time. Burgers are fantastic. Peanut stew is my go-to on rainy/gloomy/cold days.,5-star
"Date of my visit: 24-March-2018 Time of my visit: Late night, after dinner My girlfriend really liked the great dane beer handle. After calling several locations, this was the only one that had one available for sale. So we decided to stop by and pick one up. The manager, we've spoken to, was extremely courteous and helpful. The process was streamlined and we were in and out, very quickly. Overall an A experience!",5-star
"Of the places we visited in Madison, this was my favorite. Everything here was so darned good. The ladies serving up the tasty food were so nice. I had the sausage plate and it was wonderful. The sausages were very well made and spiced. The kraut and potatoes were savory goodness. I wish I had a beer, but I was traveling on business and so did not partake. My traveling companion had the chicken pot pie and said that it was delicious. I will come back again when I am in town and maybe I will try the beer.",5-star

"Beer is okay. Food is absolutely phenomenal! Green curry mussels, fried cheese curds, & fish tacos. Their brandy old fashioned was also delicious. A great place to grab food/drinks and watch the game.",5-star
"I love their brat burger. But this time we visited their fried cheese curds were average by KANSAS standards and their beer tasted just like every other brewery out there. Worse, they only stock their own beer. So, I guess they earn three stars.",3-star
"The food here is a little inconsistent. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's thoroughly mediocre. The cheese curds are the most varied. The first time I had them (some years ago) they were absolutely perfect, and sometimes I've gone back to fine them very good, but usually they are just good. The cheese is fine, but the coating is not the perfect consistency - maybe it's a little too thick or not light enough. The beer and cocktails are ok. On this last visit, I had a blackberry cocktail of some kind that was way too hard and limey for my taste. I used to always order their mac and cheese, but it's way too inconsistent. Usually it just tastes like cheese product instead of cheese. Every so often the mac and cheese is delicious, though. On this last visit I had a mozzarella and tomato salad with grilled asparagus and red peppers. It was very good. But it was too big and when I took it home in their decomposable togo box, the wetness of the mozzarella meant that the mozzarella balls stuck to the paper container and came away with lots of paper. I'm glad that they are trying to be environmentally friendly with their take out containers, but it wasn't an ideal experience. The only thing that's consistently good here is the atmosphere - it's pretty noisy, but not overly so. It's always pretty busy which is fun. One last comment is that our table was very sticky, and that's been true for the last couple of times we've been there.",3-star
"Walked in on a Saturday night for the Halloween weekend into a not too crowded place. $5 cover, Jell-O shot included, plus a mini card game for a free brewski. I'll have to come back to edit about the food and beer next time. My group and I mainly came for drinks and music. We walked up to the second floor where the DJ was getting down! Such a good variety of music. Really nice bar, pool tables, a long shuffle board game. Flat screens with a game on and disco lights. Booth seating with brew taps in the middle. Our group ordered mixed drinks at the bar and we danced the night away. Good tasting strong drinks. Cool atmosphere. Definitely a sports bar feel. I really enjoyed two floor separation. Bottom floor was more of the brewery and dining area. You could walk up stairs for more entertainment. I would highly suggest this place for a drinks/dance night out, sports events, or guys night.",4-star

"Interesting food here! And it's across the street from the Wyndham Garden hotel, which sits on the Capital City bike trail. I was here two nights in a row. The German plate was good, but the Tandoori chicken dish was excellent. It's not like you get it at an Indian restaurant. It was Tandoori spice meets Mediterranean goodness.

Best place in Madison for delicious food in a relaxed environment.",5-star
We walked in and where greeted by a very nice hostess yesterday. It was kind of weird after that. We sat inside and as we walked towards the back she told us the table she was seating us at was reserved at 5:30 so we had to be done by that time. It was 4:00 so I said I didn't think that would be a problem. There was only one other table occupied so I wondered if all the tables were reserved at 5:30. It just seemed strange since I've had reservations at other restaurants and have waited up to 2 hours. Anyway it made me feel uncomfortable and like I had to watch the time. I had the pub burger with fresh vegetables and dip and a side of frys. The vegetables were fresh and the burger was good and lean. My friend had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and green beans. The meatloaf was not good. You can't over mix the meat it gets mushy and it had too much seasoning. It was actually terrible. It had bbq sauce on it that didn't help. The potatoes were just ok and the green beans were the best part of the meal. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. She refilled our water which I really liked. I wish she would have cleared our dirty dishes though. It just wasn't a good experience,3-star
Brunch was good with lots of options to choose from. The staff is friendly and even with being busy they are able to keep drinks full and the table clear of dishes. Bloody Mary's along with craft beers make this a great place to start any Sunday.,4-star
Whenever I have someone visiting Wisconsin I have to take them to the Great Dane to check out what a Madison brew pub is like. Great menu and great execution. Their beer is also much better and smoother than most micro brews. Try their Sunday brunch. It's pricy but has more choices than most.,5-star
"Although the atmosphere of this restaurant seemed promising, my experience here was lackluster at best. Our server seemed pretty disinterested and rushed for no apparent reason since it wasn't busy at all when we were there. We got several comments like ""You guys didn't need any more water, did you?"" and had to call them back a few times as they rushed off without seeing if anyone else at our table needed anything. When our party asked some questions about the beer selection, we were met with really generic comments that sounded like our server didn't really know much about the beer and was just trying to say anything at all. I'd rather my server admit that they weren't sure and ask someone who had a better idea. ""I dunno, it kinda has like, that... flavor to it, you know what I'm talking about?"" When it came to ordering food, I was puzzled to see so much variety on the menu. Mixed with standard Wisconsin pub fare of burgers, brats, and cheese curds, there were random Caribbean jerk dishes? Falafel and couscous? I think there was some kind of Thai/Asian dish as well? It weirds me out to see that much variation, because in my experience that leads to weak dishes that won't really stand on their own. I decided to play it safe and order the Mac and Cheese with Buffalo chicken. Meh. It was advertised as being garnished with a wedge of cheese (which had me sold) and a soft pretzel. The pretzel was a small, square, semi-stale, cold pretzel roll and there was no wedge of cheese. The cheese sauce was bland and thin, the pasta was overcooked and mushy, and the slices of chicken breast were clearly not slices cut from a chicken breast but were those fast-food chewy chicken slices that are spongy and don't have much flavor. Yuck. My friends were happy about the beers they ordered though, so maybe this place stands up better as a brewery where you can order their flights, and not depend so much on the food. As it stands, this place was a waste of my money and I won't be back to give it a second chance.",1-star
"Ordered a drink and forgot ( strike one). Then brought the drink after being asked. He charged me for the one I reminded him of as well as the one I originally ordered and was t received(strike two). Brought me the wrong order for food. (Strike three). When told of this, he brought me the correct order but gave me the original side order which by that time was cold. Since he messed up more than his quota, he brought a drink chip. Too little too late as I won't go back. The only person catered to was the one picking up the tab. That is poor P. R., as all should be given proper service.",1-star
Food is usually good but it's nothing to write home about. Customer service could be improved. Common courtesy and politeness go a long way in the service industry... Some of the Fitchburg's Great Dane staff need to be reminded of this.,2-star
"I love this place for many reasons: -Great memories -Eclectic menu -Good social gathering place -Cheese curds Even before I lived in Madison, my Epic interviewer took me and the rest of the interviewees to the downtown location where we welcomed the warm, lively atmosphere and wide-ranging selections. The burgers/sandwiches, entrees, fried plantains, cheese curds have a delicious taste and no complaints. I've ordered that pork shoulder wrapped in banana leaf like 5 times before moving onto the brats and sauerkrat dish 3 more times. All the locations are pretty consistent in taste and service but the Fitchburg one was my favorite because of the ample parking lot and the roomy upstairs. I will always recommend this place over The Old Fashioned. Sometimes you just don't have 2 hours to wait for a plate of food.",4-star
The food was a cut above. You can really tell they are allowing the culinary team to be creative with the ingredients and recipes and it is paying off. Beer of course was spot on and I look forward to returning soon.,4-star
"We had a group of 23 (20 adults, 2 kids, 1 stuffed Grumpy Cat) come in for lunch and it went as well as it possibly could. They were ready for us with a dedicated waitress who was remarkably prompt and accurate for a party that large, and she even split our checks! (Shhh, they're not supposed to do that for large parties.) The Stone of Scone Scottish Ale is so good, I didn't even think about trying their other beers. The selection here is a bit smaller than their other locations, but you'll find something you like. I also like the atmosphere here - it's clean and simple, rustic without being campy, with plenty of wood. Cheese curds again win my heart. They are very large with thick but crispy, lightly fried batter. Unfortunately, they're $9, which is quite a bit more than anywhere else I tried ($5 is probably par, so this is double bogey).To maximize my cheese intake while in Wisconsin, I grabbed the mac 'n' cheese, which came with a pretzel roll and a wedge of cheddar. The wedge was disappointingly small but I enjoyed the roll and there was plenty of mac to go around. If I was thinking about deducting a star for price, the food quality rounds it right back up.",5-star
"The brunch here is really good! 15 dollars gets you lots of choices from biscuits and gravy to omelets to ice cream. Service was good and they removed plates and filled drinks regularly. It would have gotten 5 stars but some of the food was cold on the buffet line. Also, they don't take discover.",4-star
Veggie burrito is awesome and HUGE. Kid's menu was good/kid friendly options on regular menu. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the dining room lacks atmosphere. It's very plain/generic. The bar has much more character. But with kids - the dining room is a much more appropriate place to eat.,4-star
"I just went there for lunch today and had a heat-seeker's dream, the curry noodle bowl. All I can say is WOW! Great flavor in the curry soup and every ingredient sang from the pickled onions to the crispy fried noodles. It was so spicy sweat was rolling down my big rosy cheeks. I pledge allegiance to Thai coconut curry noodle bowl, you got me a food win! I paired it with the Texas Speed Bump IPA, 'twas a solid brew for the undertaking.",5-star
ALL THE GREAT DANES ARE GARBAGE...ive been to all of them and the food was absolutely horrible and mixed drinks taste like puke. They always manage to have the worst customer service and always overcook/undercook my food.....junk junk junk,1-star
"Good food and service. I have sampled much of the menu and everything has been pretty good. We always end up bringing friends and family here when they are in town. There's a wide variety of food selections to choose from, so it's easy to please everyone. It's a good place for big groups. In the summer, the outdoor patio and bar is really nice. This is also a great place to watch a game. There is a big projector screen, and there are lots of TVs upstairs.",4-star
"I really really want to give this place more than 2 stars because I have been to other locations and liked them quite a bit. And truthfully the food was quite good. However the service was severely, SEVERELY lacking. Positives: Like I said, food was good. Drinks were brought promptly, etc. etc. Negatives: Our waitress. She said she was new, so maybe the blame should ultimately be placed on the management for lack of adequate training. First off, we had a table of 7 and she said for tables of 8 or more they don't do separate checks. So when we repeated that we only had 7 at our table, she still gave us attitude about having to split checks. I know it's a pain in the butt but no one in our party had cash.... Then she forgot a few of our drinks. They were brought promptly but when you forget a few, and also forget the waters we ordered and never come back to check on us again until you bring our food out, we may have a problem. So 2 people we were with went about 20 minutes without drinks while the rest of us were sipping our beer and wine (and missing our waters.) When we went to order our food, a guy we were with asked what came on his sandwich and she replied ""well you can read can't you?"" Um. Ok. Then our food came out. We ate it, liked it, and then sat there for about a half hour after we had all finished eating. We were upstairs and there was almost nobody else up there so I'm not sure why it took so long for her to come back and pick up our plates (or ask us if we wanted more drinks?) She finally came back and we asked for the checks, she brought them and we paid. And then sat there again for about a half hour. At this point we were all super frustrated. It took a bartender to realize how long we'd been sitting there and he finally came and took care of our checks. UGH. All in all, I love there food and that they cater so well to us gluten free folk. But I probably won't be back to this location for a while.",2-star
"I had such a great time here! We were a party of 8 and they sat us almost immediately for sunday brunch. They have a huge all you can eat, self service, brunch buffet that does not lack in quality. It included such food items as: mashed potatoes, shrimp, waffles, bacon, sausage links, fresh fruit, a carvery, salad, cakes, pancakes, and much more. They were also serving their late night pub menu which we ordered a few apps and burgers off of. Their cheese curds were tasty but were not really cheese curds, they were more of mozzarella sticks in the shape of balls. The burgers were tasty and came with some cool toppings but I thought the bun could have been more dense and flavorful. The two best parts of this establishment for me was the games (I played billiards and shuffle board) and the service. Juliette was my server and she was absolutely amazing. She is incredibly sweet and made sure we had everything we needed to fully enjoy our dining experience. She even split up our bill for us which I know is a pain to do especially for a large party.",5-star
"I figured it was time for an update...to report on the consistently high quality of service, food, and ambiance delivered by the folks here. My most frequent form of visit is to treat myself to an occasional work lunch, usually eaten in the bar area, and do some reading. I have always received friendly, warm, and attentive service from the folks. It's a really nice refreshing escape from a stressful workday....my menu/food selections vary but, some of my favorites are the Tuna Rolls, green chili, spicy peanut stew, Reuben, or the fallafal. But, be still my beating heart...I've ignored the menu too long...and failed to notice/forgot about the meatloaf....until..... and it was SO YUMMY on such a cold day....a very generous slab of meatloaf, first baked, then heated on the grill....a generous serving or baby red mashed potatoes, green beans, and a mountain of onion strings....who knew you could get all four food groups in such a delicious package...meat, vegetable, carbs, and deep fried :) HUGE portion....I have left overs hint: If you do come in a group, at lunch time, expect to wait, especially on Thursday or Friday....come a little earlier, and consider sitting in the bar. Also, check the upstairs bad...it's a little different but, same great menu and service!",5-star
"Yes, it pains me to write this but it has been a long time coming. I have been a life long fan of the 'Dane"" and have basically grew up with it...starting in college when it first opened in 1994. It was always a place you could count on for outstanding beers and very solid food. Unfortunately, this is no more. The beers, once different and unique, are now pedestrian at best. The Scotch Ale no longer has the flavor and finish that it used to. The specials are ""special"" in name alone. One can only conclude that cheaper ingredients and the large growth has caught up to them. Same can be said about the food. Always a big fan of the calamari with banana peppers, the appetizer now is overbreaded, overcooked, and lacks flavor. The same can't be said about the Texarkana burger. Piled high with bacon, onion straws and slathered with BBQ sauce, the burger was juicy and flavorful. A small highlight in an otherwise gloomy night. For a visual perspective, the Fitchburg location is appealing and comfortable. The dark wood in the bar and high ceilings make it welcoming. I will say the dining room feels more like a Dennys that a brewpub however. In 1994, the Dane was something new and different on the Madison restaurant scene. Craft brews were still new and the concept of a brewpub was as well. They did well establishing themselves and now it appears they are content to rest on their laurels. With restaurants/bars/gastropubs sprinkled all throughout Madison that serve better beer and better fare, the Dane best wake up and improve or just locate in other cities (like Wausau) where the competition isn't as fierce.",2-star
"FOR SOME REASON SOME OF THE REVIEWS ON YELP GOT MIXED UP SO THE ONE I WROTE FOR THE DOWNTOWN LOCATION IS INCORRECT BUT THIS FITCHBURG LOCATION IS SPECTACULAR!!! This is such an amazing place and Unique to the Fitchburg area. Out of the 4 Great Danes in Madison, I think this one is by far the best. It just seems to have more character and life to it. It is really warm when you walk in like you have been a customer for years and the staff treats you just the same. They have an unbelievable knack for crafting beers which are delicious and plentiful. They have a gorgeous balcony with a huge grill and of course taps within a 5ft reach. It is gated to keep those pesky kids out and the drunken fun in! The Great Dane Fitchburg is always so well kept; it's clean and shiny like it had just opened for the first time. Their food is amazing as well! I have had countless items off the menu so there is no one thing that I like more over another. The seats are massive and envelope you and make you feel like your curled up in a big LazyBoy chair while you eat. Don't forget all the massive TV's to watch the games on! Now the 1 coolest thing about this location? Barry Alvarez people! Yeah! He is here on Thursday nights! Anyways, this location has the feeling of class, a warm Fitchburg feeling and really nice people. Especially the staff!",5-star
"The food was amazing as always and the drinks were perfect! Only thing I have to complain about is that I waiting 5-10 mins at the bar to get another drink! I have came just to drink ya the bar before and never had any issues, not sure If it was new staff or something but very weird!",3-star
The Keg steakhouse location on the west island is really nice and upscale. The staff are very well organized in handling the customers as they arrive. We had a reservation for 5:30 and were seated within 5 minutes of arriving. We were not impressed when they told us we had be out by 9pm. We understand but do not push us before we even get seated. Not a good start. We started out with house fresh mixes salads. Well when you find the core of the head of lettuce that is brown and cut into your salad sure displays poor quality control and was turn off. The server did take the brown core pieces away. A few minutes later the manager did show up at our table . He was apologetic but then he start making excuses. The steaks arrived which mine was suppose to be medium but was partially on a rare side and was not hot but warm. But the bake potato was cold . At this point our server was no where to be found . A few minutes into our meal the manager did come by to see if everything was ok. I did ask him to touch my potato to see first hand that the potato was cold . He was hesitant at first but when he did touch it he immediately agreed and stated that this was unacceptable . He said he would get me a hot potato. When he did return he stated that he was not happy with our experience and was taking it off the bill. That was the right way to handle the matter . That being said the kitchen staff and chef should understand when someone is spending a lot of money for a steak and salad they do expect everything to be perfect and not sloppy. We will give this location another try and we will update the review . Tonight The Keg was a miss !,2-star
"Went here for our second time this last New Years Eve to get the evening started. A note, on busy nights they fill up fast, so if you are a group I would advise calling in a reservation. Luckily for my fiancé and I, we came early enough that we were immediately seated without a reservation! The service was great and the waitress knew the menu well and gave great recommendations. We had a great dinner with some wine and champagne before heading out fully satiated and ready for some more champagne chez nous. I've been to many of this chains' locations in Montreal, Toronto and Whistler and I have never left disappointed!",5-star
"Excellent food and service. The steak is tender and juicy. We had a good time here. I recommend the rib steak the most. Since my aunt doesn't eat rare steak, we ordered medium cooked rib steak under the recommendations. It seems that this cut will allow the steak to be cooked more without being tough inside. Overall, it was a great experience and I will definitely come back again.",5-star
"Food and drinks were awesome as usual. Only issue I had was when bartender ordered the waitress to clean the glasses...and then proceeded to complain to Manager about issue...all in front of me and my friend. Honestly, not a cheap place to visit - I don't really want staff's issues discussed while I am trying to enjoy myself. I was not impressed with this and hope she learns to be careful when and where to be bossy and try to score points with the Manager.",3-star
"I took my cousin for dinner to thank her for helping me with my service to seniors in the area of housing. I wanted our dinner to be fabulous and it was! The staff were professional and attentive. Our food was excellent, starting with our salads and ending with a lovely mini cream brûler!",5-star
"Over the years of going to the keg, I've never had a steak not cooked to perfection. They also give reassurance if you've indicated any allergy to the waiter, 2 min later someone else comes to ensure that they're prepping the kitchen to account for this allergy. It's very comforting for those who're worried about this.",5-star
This is a great chain of steakhouses. I've been to the one in Toronto and it was excellent. When I saw my hotel was close to here I had to go. First off the service is fantastic. From the check in to the waiter everything was great. Now on to the food I love the mushrooms Neptune they are very good for stuffed mushrooms. I didn't order them but saw many get the nachos and they looked amazing. I ordered the classic prime rib which comes with a salad and I ordered the wedge. I love dressing and a lot of it and it came with the right amount and was very good. The prime rib was cooked just how I ordered it medium rare and was so good. As far as sides I've only had the twice baked potato and it's always so good.,5-star
Never disappoints. Best Keg location in the city. Been to the others and always am disappointed. Each meal I've had at this location has been better then the last. The service is top notch and not to mention walking in on a Saturday night and waiting less then 5 minutes for a table for 4 - can't be beat!!,5-star
"TLDR: Fun place for a 5 a 7 and for parties in the West end. Great 5 a 7 deals of well-made cocktails and food. You can't go wrong with the cocktails. I've tried the dark and stormy, tequila cinnamon, bloody mary, and much more and they were all well balanced. If you prefer virgin drinks, their Virgin Mary has quite the kick to it. Their wine and beer lists are also nice. Let's discuss the food: Their nachos are vibrant in colour and flavour, and I recommend topping them with chicken. The fried calamari comes with fried red bell peppers and fried slices of jalapeno for some extra flavour. Their house salad is great for people who are peckish but would rather drink their calories than eat them. Service is efficient, even when involving large groups. If you're looking for a more sophisticated place to hold your gathering in the west end, instead of a pub, this chain is for you.",4-star
"Short and to the point... The Keg serves up delicious food, all at a reasonable price considering the portion sizes. Add amazing service and this place is definitely a go-to. You can chose between the louder, more business-casual bar area or the regular dining area for a quieter evening. There is also an upstairs, which I think is for larger groups. There is something for everyone! Quick story... I ordered the rib steak, medium rare. It came more towards medium. The waiter noticed, without even being prompted and offered to replace it. The steak was still excellent, so I declined the offer. Instead, to our surprise, the waiter brought us a huge piece of mocha ice cream cake for dessert, as an apology for the inconvenience. That is a defining feature of a 5 star restaurant.",5-star
"This Keg is better than your average steak house. The patio upstairs is great in the summer. A nice view of the Holiday Inn. The steak is standard, but the bar menu has interesting items. Caution! The portabello mushroom burger is actually vegetarian.",5-star
"Looking for a nice steakhouse-style dinner my wife and I were on the lookout for a great place to go. Where did we find the answer, well none other than Yelp of course. Located close by and what appeared to be a very nice environment we settled on The Keg. When walking up to the restaurant, which is attached to a mall, we were not expecting too much on the inside. However, when you enter you are immediately reminded that you are dinning at a steakhouse. With tall ceilings and dark lighting, the mood was set for a relaxing and intimate dinner. The décor was modern without being overdone. The restaurant felt cozy and inviting while have a small touch of masculinity. We sat down at our table and our server promptly came by and got our drink order. My wife got the white sangria and I a local hefeweizen. Both of which were remarkable and tasty. Not being hungry enough we just got meals. While waiting for our food we received complimentary bread. It was good but noting to write home about. When my chicken came to the table it made my mouth water and I was eager to eat it. The chicken itself was cook perfectly with a crispy skin and a juicy and succulent center. Served over a bead of asiago rice with a sweet chili sauce over the top. The flavors overall were great, a nice play between textures and the sweet and spicy. Overall, a very good dish and something I would recommend to anyone who is looking for something a little lighter but not lacking any flavor. The major drawback to our experience overall was the service. Other that being prompt when we first got there our server kind of fell off. She was never rude or impolite, however, while waiting for another drink and the food we noticed her just standing and chatting. Overall experience was good, just a few minor things that could be cleaned up and honed in on.",3-star
"Great food, Louis was a great bartender. Great cocktails like the house made Drunken Cherry and great beer, Kissmeyer Nordic Pale Ale was available when I visited. Louis is a great bartender and even threw in a taste of some dessert! This was definitely one of the highlights of my work visit to the Montreal area! I'd definitely come back!",5-star
"I love the Keg!! Ate a lot! Escargot pretty good, preferred it in the shell though, but with the garlic cheese toast, a perfect pairing. Onion soup and surf and turf, just what I expected. But the billy miner pie exceeded my expectations! I'll return on my next trip to Montreal!!",5-star
"Totally recommend going here for a great night out. I have been there multiple times and have always had great service and great food. Is perfect for a romantic night out or even a fun night out with a group of friends. Prices aren't too high and you definitely get what you pay for, love it.",5-star
"You can't really go wrong with The Keg. It's never an earth shattering culinary experience but if you are in the mood for steak it does the job fairly well. Noise level in this restaurant is very high and it has always been crowded on all my (3) visits so far. The upstairs terrace is nice in the summertime. Inside is rather dimly lit and noisy. Food is good, wine is fairly priced but could use a revamped wine list with more choice.",4-star
"My first time here could not have went better. But here I am, my second time around at the Keg. I must say that it was on a saturday night at 6pm. We were 5 people waiting for a table in the dining room. They told us it would take about 90 min. Nothing wrong with that, don't mind waiting for a table while drinking at their beautiful bar. But the people I was with accepted a table at the bar instead, being that the wait would be 10 min. instead of 90... Things were looking up when they offered us a table in the dining room because someone else preferred to be in the bar to watch the game, even better! But after 45 min of waiting and all these promises, here comes the same guy telling us now that it was all a mistake on his part, that we couldn't be seated in the dining room area!? So the table we initially had accepted at the bar was gone and so as the other one in the dining room! So he offers us a round of drinks and appetizers. And promises us the next bar table available. What a fiasco! Fridays and Saturdays are quite complicated days to get a table here. I think you need to reserve before 6pm, otherwise, good luck! The booth tables at the back of the bar are not meant to have a full dinner on, way too small, very akward and annoying for everyone. Can't fit much on there, especially if we all have drinks and water (which apparently you need to ask for, the days of bringing water all around seem to be gone, here) Not a good experience, especially when you end up paying over $400 to get under cooked vegetables, watered-down drinks, tough fillet mignon, and a seating fiasco to boot! Pretty but not well orchestrated.",2-star
"Première visite à ce steak house dans l'ouest de Montreal pour un souper d'affaire avec des clients. Je suis arrivé plus tôt que les autres et j'ai décidé aller prendre un verre au bar en attendant. A mon arrivée à la réception il devait avoir au moins 10 jeunes filles habilles en robes noires qui parlaient tellement fort que j'avais peine à entendre ce que me disait l'hôtesse au sujet de ma réservation. Très mauvais première impression et j'espérais qu'elles étaient tous sur le point de se trouver quelque chose a faire avant l'arrivée de mes clients. Les jeunes serveuses jouaient avec une petite fille de 3-4 ans. Au bar j'ai du attendre plusieurs minutes avant que quelqu' un ne vienne me servir puisque la préposée au bar elle aussi jouait en avant avec la petite. Il ne semblait pas avoir personne en charge pour voir à ce chaos a l'entrée. La bar est très sombre mais quand même un beau décord moderne tout neuf. Ensuite a la table nous avons eu un service un service exceptionnel de la part de Phanny qui a sauvé la soirée. Les deux entrées de crevettes et calamars étaient excellentes. Pour ce qui est des viandes mes invités et moi même avons été très satisfait. Le filet mignon et les coupes NY ont été grillés tels que demandes. Une excellente carte de vins est disponible. Pour ma part je trouves les prix trop élevés mais au moins contrairement à d'autres endroits, nous n'avions pas a commander nos garnitures a part a prix ridicules. Le stationnement est facile.",3-star
"Came here with my bestie on a Friday night, and had a great time. My friend had arrived before me, but didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated (Friday at 6:15). Our waitress was just the sweetest. It had been a long week, so I was deserving of a large glass of white wine (haha), and she recommended a great choice. My friend had their ahi tuna, and I decided to try the lobster and shrimp salad. It. was. delicious. Probably one of the best salads I have ever had! The shrimp and lobster were super fresh, the dressing was delicious, and the salad had all of my favourite foods - avocado, beans, and mushrooms. Yummy!! The ambiance was great, one of those nicer restaurants you can bring your kids to without feeling out of place. Sometimes restaurants hand you the bill with the underlying reason that ""it's time for you to go"", but our waitress told us to enjoy and take our time, which was nice not to feel rushed. That being said. I shall be back...for that salad! ;)",4-star
"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, can be jammed on the weekends. Food is good but the draft beer isn't great the 3 times I've been there I've had to switch to bottle beer.

"I must say I was quite disappointed with the fact that the restaurant does NOT take reservations for dinner after 6pm on weekdays/weekends.So your reservations are only valid if you dine between 5-6pm. So I took the chance to go without a reservation, and the end result was a 45 minute wait(Standing!)Keep in mind this was only for a table of two people. The hostess was not very helpful. Why this location is NOT open for lunch on weekdays, is quite surprising while the others such as The Keg downtown Montreal does provide lunch! I'm not impressed with restaurant that has this good of a reputation(In other locations!) My suggestion, if you don't mind the extra drive, you're better off going to the one situated in downtown Montreal.",2-star

The wine spot is not just wine. It's craft beer and artisan snacks. They have really fun drink debuts/tastings and know their stuff. From bubbly to craft brews -- the staff can lead you in a fun direction to try something new and different. A perfect evening at the wine spot includes several drinks at the bar, bring your own pizza (Dewey's, anyone?), bring a deck of cards and enjoy. Then, leave with a 6-pack of the beer you just fell in love with, because The Wine Spot also has a great selection of beer and wine to take home. Or.. come with a group! They have couches in the back for you to just hang. Because they think of everything. A local favorite. Can't say it enough!",5-star
"Great spot. My wife and I came out to visit from out west and we're delighted to find this gem in the neighborhood. The staff is very knowledgeable about their product, giving some in depth descriptions and advice regarding what we were in the mood for. We had a great experience with one of the staff members, Megan, who's knowledge on wines around the world far surpassed what we were used to back in Los Angeles. If you're unsure as to what wines to get for a dinner party, like we were - or something else you might need wine advice for - please check this place out. They also have a lot of various craft beers, whiskey's, and other goodnesses I love. It's worth a stop. If I lived here, I'd be a regular. Oh yeah, they serve mixed drinks, beer, and wine here too. I had their ""Oh Danny bOYO"" St. Patrick's Day cocktail and it was amazing.",5-star

The young lady was able to help me pick out 2 whites and 1 red. A little birdie told me what type of wine they liked. It was reasonably priced amd there was plenty of parking. I'm looking forward to going back and enjoying some wine for myself. As for tonight?! The wine spot made it easier to get ahead in my mission. Thanks",4-star
"So glad I (and 8 girlfriends) stumbled upon this place in CLE this past weekend! We stopped in for some afternoon drinks and snacks and ended up staying for 3 hours! Its a store with tons and tons of wine and beer as well as cool bartending tools and serving ware and fun trinkets. Everyone had different types of wine, I had a flight (tastings are $4 a glass, so you can order 3-4 for a full flight). We also ordered almost every cheese and meat board they offer, all of which were outstanding. The star of the show, as silly as is sounds, was the pickle board! It came out with 5 different types of pickles/pickled peppers and all of them were sooooooo yummy. The finger food was exactly what we needed to hold us over until dinner. Beyond the quality food/wine, the service was great! I had been looking for a specific type of Spanish wine and I asked a manager about it. He proceeded to walk me over to the shelf and describe each bottle they had in great detail. It was awesome, he wasnt pushing a sale, he just genuinely was passionate about wine and educating me on the different brands. If I was a Cleveland resident I'd be hitting up this place all the time!",5-star
"I like this place, I feel like a cultured individual, like someone who acts my age, like an aristocrat,because they have wine. But wait there is more, the have a great selection beer on tap and bottles, that makes me feel like the every day joe, a man of the people. But wait there is more, they have nice liquor selection, with an emphasis on whiskey. That makes me feel like a degenerate booze hound. So in a nutshell if your a degenerate, an aristocrat, or just a man/women of the people, there is something for everyone here. The lay out is pretty wide open with tables and chairs; they even have a small room in the back that would be perfect for an AA meeting.",4-star
"Stopped in here while waiting for a restaurant to open nearby. Open and airy, great selection, trendy decor, and my favorite... EXTREMELY friendly and knowledgable staff. I was very warmly greeted by every employee working like I was an old friend. They had great suggestions.

"I've been here a handful of times now. To meet old friends, to enjoy alone time with a good book and a glass of wine, and for the tastings. I believe the biggest reason why I can't give five stars is because I wish ""the spot"" was set up so that the flow of buying didn't conflict with the flow of enjoying your purchase. I say that to say this: I wonder if I'm the only one who feels like I'm in the way here? Seating is first come, first take, and it is limited. So, many people find themselves standing around and gawking at all of the pretty beers, and wines that they can purchase instead of sitting - it just leaves me feeling like we're all in limbo instead of getting to fully enjoy ourselves in such a great little ""spot"". I love their selection. Beers I can't find anywhere else, I know I can get here. Same thing with wine. They even have coffee on draft. (It's thin and not nearly as heavy as a stout, which was what I expected. It's actually very floral and clean. Not bitter.) I recommend going on a Saturday afternoon. Business is slow and you'll find a great seat anywhere. Bring your book, your bestie, or meet up with an old friend. The environment is very chill and cozy. There are tables available outside the entrance. (Great people watching on Lee Rd.)",4-star
$10 corking fee is way too much for Lee Road in Cleveland. if you did $5 or even free with good purchase your place would be full and people would be happy. I was ready to buy a $40 bottle of wine but was not willing to pay $10 to have a glass. some nice wines but really need to rethink that corking fee. there was absolutely no one in the place and I assume that is why,3-star
"Friendly staff, cool ambiance to stay and have a drink or buy something to go. My favorite place to buy alcohol or have a casual drink on the east side.",5-star
"I'm just remarking on the beer. I have bought more than one 6 pack from this store that was already expired. I've bought a couple 6 packs that came within a few days of expiration. I looked over their single beer selection (make your own six pack) and seen beers with an expiration date over 2 years past!! I would go because, up until recently, they had the only Sunday beer sales in my area that you could get to on foot. I would NEVER shop for beer at this location. Plus the prices are $1-2 more than if you drive down the road to a grocery that sells beer that isn't flat or skunked. When I brought the beer back I was able to get a refund or rummage around for something drinkable without having to be a prick. I can't speak to the wine selection or the special events. So if you're looking to get that info read another review.",1-star
"Okay beer selection. They have some variety but not impressive. A few beers on tap which is great. Pick a draft and then explore the aisle of take home beer. I think it is shady that they charge a $1.50 ""corkage"" fee to drink onsite when u buy a bottle in house",2-star
"We used The Wine Spot for all of our wedding beer and wine and they were fantastic. Brian was our point of contact and was really great to work with and helpful. They paired our wine with our food, did a wonderful tasting, and chilled/delivered all of our alcohol. They also did a great job staying well within our budget. We ended up taking our out-of-town guests to The Wine Spot to hang out the day after our wedding too and had a great time!",5-star
"It's the place to go for the best selection of beer, wine, drinks and a cool selection of local Cleveland food products",5-star
"I must say The Wine Spot is such a great little place on Lee Rd. I have been buying wine at this place for the past two years and have nothing but amazing things to say... Adam and the team always have great recommendations for wine and beer for all occasions. Not to throw people off while they do have quite the wine stock they also carry a great deal of beers. They recently moved things around to allow for more seating and it's always fun to come after work and have a nice glass of rosé on the comfy couch in the back or out front on the patio for some sun... Overall this place has it all for your wine needs.. They even have space to host events and they do tastings, have live music, rotate local artwork and even do monthly painting classes.. With all that available, What more could you ask for?",5-star
Fantastic! We had a get together with friends there. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They served a fantastic cheese board. For dinner they let is bring in from another restaurant since they do t have a kitchen. We could not have been more pleased with them for a casual night out.,5-star
"I will keep this review short by simply saying this place is great! I have visited this store about 4 times now and each time I find a new gem of a beer. They always have great singles to make a mixed 6 pack, few beers on tap, and great service. I don't travel to Cleveland for the wine so while their selection is massive I can't say how great it is. But case in point of how great their service is....we just went up to Cleveland for beer week and I called around seeing if anyone had Three Floyds beers. They said ""yeah we got some Zombie Dust."" Well any beer nerd knows this is a great score! So two other stores I talked to said they had some but it was 1 bottle per customer (since each store gets only a few cases). So when I asked if they'd hold any for me since I wouldn't be in town til the next day I expected the response from Jingle All The Way when Arnold asks if they have any Turbo Mans in the back...however the girl said ""sure how many you want me to hold?"" They had a 2-bottle limit per customer and knowing there would be 3 of us I asked for a 6 pack. Next day I showed up..there it was waiting for me, and the guy working was extremely nice also. I said I would keep it short, but hey I had to tell this story...I will visit this place everytime I go to Cleveland.",5-star
"The Wine Spot is one of my favorite places on Lee Road, and a great addition to the area! I love the look and overall feel, and gave them an extra star for now serving both beer and wine by the glass! I do think they need more inexpensive ""Tuesday wines"" (and beers) before this will beat Zagaras or Giant Eagle for our normal alcohol purchases. Sometimes you just want a $6 bottle of weekday wine! I recently helped host a bridal shower in the back area with the private room, and it was a huge hit! I would definitely consider using them again as they were very helpful and the space worked perfectly. They also have wine and beer tastings (often with live music) that are a great addition to the area.",4-star
Such a large variety of wine as well as beer. They have even ordered beer for me when they didn't have what I was looking for. The staff is very knowledgable and friendly. I would suggest buying your booze here.,5-star
Owner spoke of adding some taps for consumption on site. Perfect. Beer while you browse is my kind of thing! +1 (Last i was there they had taps but would not pour glasses) You can fill your growler! +2 Took the girlfriend and the extremely helpful cashier/guy helped us find exactly what we were looking for. +3 Craft beers. Local wines. World wines. Knowledgeable employees. Party room in the back?,5-star
"Such a great local wine store. The owner has hooked us up with fabulous wines. Even if we don't know the vineyard, he has never steered us wrong. The atmosphere is great for tastings. Always something new!",5-star
"Got a wine-o in your life? Take them here. This is the kind of spot I wish I could pick up and literally place closer to my hood. I put up with some *really* mediocre wine because I can easily grab it close to my house. But if Wine Spot was closer to me, I'd be much better off (well... maybe not, ha.) Why? First, they have awesome tastings weekly that you cannot miss--so much fun. I can't wait to go to another. The lady who was pouring was super-helpful and actually talked about the wines in laymen terms. Thank GOD! Nothing is worse than nodding knowingly on the inside and freaking out from confusion on the inside. I've never been good at tasting wines and pointing out specific flavors or qualities, other than any sort of smokey/oakiness (bleh), tanins and legs. But after some thorough and easy-to-understand info from this staff member, I was picking out fruity hints, rustic-ness and more! Second, their selection is amazeballs. Their very large space is lined with walls of bottles. They even have non-wine items for sale, so putting together an amazing gift basket is a snap. I think they even have some pre-made, but don't quote me on that... Better yet, they sell local cheeses! Areyakiddingme? Third, their space, although large, is very warm and inviting. I love that they feature local art from students at CIA. What a great, real-world experience for these students and how sweet of him to showcase their work. They also have a private room! The history of the space is also pretty neat--don't forget to look at the old tile floor they discovered and restored.",4-star
"Love love love this place! As Cleveland newcomers, The Wine Spot was one of our first stops. We were warmly welcomed by the owner/manager, who remembered our faces upon our next visit! The staff is uber-friendly and they have awesome free events! We actually won tickets to a Seal concert at the last Rock The Block Wine Spot event! The selection of wine and import beers is excellent, and the staff is very knowledgeable about all of their inventory. The Wine Spot also supports the community by offering products benefiting local businesses and charities. Love that!",5-star
"Situated in the old Seitz-Agin Hardware Store, this wine and beer shop is a nice addition to the Cedar-Lee neighborhood. Besides Zagara's, which is a bit further afield from the main drag on Lee, this area has been seriously lacking in a good wine shop, and I hope to see the Wine Spot fill the void. The space seems dauntingly huge on first glance, but if you keep in mind that they feature tastings on a fairly regular basis it seems just right. The owners have done impressive renovations to the space, and the new look is clean and modern -- lots of shiny chrome and reworked A Piece of Cleveland surfaces, as well as displays made by local artists -- yet surprisingly comfortable and homey all the same. I like it here. The beer selection, in coolers, is pretty average. Your choices range among various craft brews, Yuengling, and seasonals. Nothing that really knocked my socks off, but still a good selection for the size of the store. Beer snobs will not be disappointed! The wine inventory is the main focus here --hence the shop's name -- and doesn't disappoint. It's not a huge, overwhelming selection, but rather a very well-curated selection of wines in a variety of price points and, well, varietals. $12 bottles comingled with $50 bottles, arranged by region and grape. I found a lot of labels I wasn't familiar with yet as well as a few surprises that I love and haven't been able to find anyplace else (Selby Cabernet, for example). Haven't tried the tastings yet, but they seem to be turning up pn the shop's calendar with some frequency now that things are really in full swing. I'm definitely looking forward to checking these out in the future!",5-star
They must have spent so much money making the place look nice and decided not to invest in having enough products to fill the place. It looks like you could go bowling in the wasted spaces. The staff does not seem to be as knowledgeable as competing retailers are.,1-star
"After a great introductory article in the Sun-Press, I had to stop here and was glad I did. Adam and Susan Fleischman have beautifully redecorated the old Seitz-Akin hardware store into a hip space perfect for wine tastings. And they have LOTS of wine tastings scheduled (see their website). Adam is super friendly without being ostentatious or pushy. Their wines run the gamut from ""get it at this price"" under $10 to ""I'm so worldly"" $75 and up bottles. I picked up two bargains and plan to give them a taste this weekend. Nice mead, port and beer areas, too. The art on the walls is sourced at CIA, so that's an innovative aside. Stop in!",5-star
Finally a wine shop in Cleveland Heights. They have a great Italian selection that you can't find in supermarkets. Adam (the owner) is really helpful. Ask for Fred a sicilian guy that can speak for hours about Italian Wines. I bought a 25$ valpolicella ripasso and it is the best wine I have ever had. I will come back soon to buy another one. Wine spot highly recommended.,5-star
"A true one-stop shop for all of your wine and beer needs. We recently popped into this artistically driven space to pick up some holiday cheer and were delighted to see a huge selection of wine and beers. The space serves as a local art hot spot for the CIA and also features cool handcrafted wine accessories from local craftsman. We sampled a few different bottles of sparkling whites and landed on a Cava and a Prosecco. Both perfect for holiday toasts and unique enouigh to catch the attention of our guests. if you are looking for a bottle for any occasion, this place will have it. The price range can meet anyone's needs... from the ""drinking alone at home tonight"" to the ""I need to impress the crowd with my bottle of 1954... blah blah"" ... Check em' out!",5-star
"This wasy first time here and I must say they did not disappoint!!! I had the English breakfast and my wife the Eggs Florentine and we shared an order of Brioche French Toast. It was exactly what I need for Brunch!!! Go check them out, you will love it!!!",5-star

"Tuck Shop is one of the best places to have dinner in Phoenix. The food is always on point, the wine and cocktails are absolutley amazing and the atmosphere just feels like home. Another great aspect to Tuck Shop and what truly creates the ""feels like home"" vibe are the people that Owner Grace U. has brought together behind the bar, in the kitchen, and on the floor. Grace goes above and beyond to take care of her people and her customers. My husband and I, an interracial couple has always felt at home at Tuck Shop. Tuck Shop is a great place to get dinner and find new friends for all people. Any claim that there is discrimination at the Tuck Shop is completely false. I being a black man fully approve of Tuck Shop and its crew. I will also say that Grace is someone who wants to know of any concern in her place so that it can be corrected immediately. Thank you Tuck Shop! We will be back in soon. Kelvin",5-star
"The Cheese Curds are AMAZING. The server was sweet at pie. We got a bunch of small plates that all were delicious. The only sad part was we really wanted the Fried Chix and Waffels and the server forgot to ""fire"" it so we never got it, I was a bummed as I went there specifically for that dish. Other than that, it was a great little spot and very chic ambiance.",4-star
This is my favorite place to eat in Phoenix. Much more character and charm than most places in Phoenix. The food and service are fantastic! The bartender is great too. The ambiance is relaxed yet sophisticated. Great place for visiting with friends and they will let you take as long as you like for dinner.,5-star
"Food was outstanding. I tried the cheese curds, the Brussels sprouts, the beet ravioli - all amazing! With that said, if you actually want to get full - make sure you order a 'large plate' haha. the appetizers and small plates are just that - small, as in tiny.. as in not a full meal. And for $11-16 you'd be sad to not be full -(my bill with tax and tip came to $19 for 4 ravioli and coffee) so spend the extra money and get yourself a large meal (you'll thank me). But, the quality of the food was beyond excellent and extremely appealing to the eye as well. A very cute place, snuggled in a neighborhood, great atmosphere, and really sweet waitress! I will come again, but next time - it's gonna be chicken and waffles for me!!",4-star
This is a very nice place. The food was wonderful and the service was too! I highly recommend it! We did the English Tea and it was great!,5-star
Cheese curds and wine in a great neighborhood spot. 'Nuff said. The rest of the food is good too! A great spot for the little better than casual date night or a dinner with friends...,5-star
"I will absolutely return to this PHX gem. The food was much better than I anticipated given that some restaurants scale back in the summer months - not Tuck Shop. We had the cheese curds in beer batter as an appetizer and they were wonderful. The roasted garlic was well done but probably the least impressive. Our small plates included the pan fried gnocchi, tuna tartare and beet crudo ravioli. incredibly fresh and cooked to perfection. Our server was helpful and suggested a new Rose wine on their menu which was perfect with the summer heat. Standing ovation.",5-star
"I wish I would have found this gem earlier in my Phoenix trip. Eclectic, fun, and delicious. Since I was dining solo, I sat at the bar and even though there was a loud group at the end of the bar celebrating after work, the bartender was super attentive. I had a relaxing dinner, enjoying a glass of malbec and the Street Taco Salad -- al pastor con pina, grilled corn, pickled carrot, avocado crema. Really delicious. The bits of pineapple made the dish. I wish I had been hungrier so I could have ordered more! This might be out of your way, but seek out Tuck Shop!",5-star
Good place but they can do a lot better on having more vegetarian options. The atmosphere is really great. It is a bit pricey but the food is good. I'll return and hope they up their vegetarian options.,2-star
"An appropriate English name as this restaurant is ""tucked"" inside a residential area in an unlikely, but inviting space. But there it is...this quaint and elegant place that seemed to crank out dish after dish of sumptuousness. The Tuck Shop on this hot, non-touristy summer night was filled with local patrons. I spied order after order of chicken with waffles pass me by and their fall-off-the-bone pork dishes, including their ribs and pork belly. We ordered both at our table and it did not disappoint. We started out with their cheese curbs that are lightly coated with bread crumbs and sprinkled with, I am guessing, Kosher salt. For dessert, we shared their wonderful creme brûlée that comes almost as a double order. Oh, lest I forget, I ordered the tastiest cold soup; thickened by soaking bread into the broth and then using the blender. It was a red pepper stock that came with thinly sliced apples and crusty, thinly sliced bread. Delicious! Our waitress was both knowledgable and attentive. We found her to be genuine and a pleasure when she appeared at the table. The only suggestion would be to expand the wine selections, especially the Chardonnay as the only choice was pricey at, I believe, $13.00 a glass. Overall, this is not an inexpensive dinner if you include drinks, but the food is outstanding and we will return again! Bravo.",5-star
"We hadn't visited Tuck Shop since it first opened, so we decided to check it out tonight for dinner. The atmosphere is simple, but comfortable, the service is fantastic and the food was amazing. I enjoyed a black cherry champagne cocktail to kick start the night, we shared the pigs in a blanket starter and I enjoyed the special chilean sea bass with pineapple salsa, coleslaw and prickly pear cornbread...so delicious! Tuck Shop will definitely be added on our regular rotation of restaurants...it is just that good!",5-star
I was there after work last week and had great service. Excellent selection both food and beer and will return again. Staff and manager pleasant and nice. Thanks for good time,5-star
"The restaurant is tucked away in a neighborhood on the outskirts of downtown phoenix. The parking lot is small but I believe there to be plenty of street parking surrounding it. The sign was the first thing that caught my eye. Made with colorful toy blocks that made me smile as I entered the restaurant. It is a dainty and intimate restaurant for perfect for a chill evening out with a significant other or friend. My friend and I sat down and decided to order the mac and cheese, taco salad and bbq beef ribs to share. The salad was delicious with the portion being bigger than we both expected. The mac and cheese was good at first but we both figured it to be a little too heavy and salty for our taste. By the time the ribs came out though, we barely had room left in our stomachs. Ended up shairing one rack (4 ribs) between the two of us and packed the rest to go. I thought the service was okay for how not busy the restaurant was and would prefer to taste more from the kitchen before giving it an extra star. Definitely enjoyed our time there, however, and wouldnt mind going back!",3-star
"Where do I start. Well for one the atmosphere is very cozy, trendy and hip. It was the perfect place to relax and connect with my friend. The staff was so friendly, kind, and attentive. I don't think my water got below half a glass before someone filled it up, and I drink A LOT of water. The food was like heaven, it was perfect in every way. If you don't choose this restaurant, you are truly missing out! A MUST in Phoenix!",5-star
"How have I not written a review for one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix yet? Bad Rachel! Tuck Shop is a great spot, tucked away in a neighborhood, and full of delicious seasonal food. They not only have a rotating menu, but an extensive wine list and create their own syrups in-house for cocktails. Their mac n cheese (WITH LOBSTER OBVIOUSLY) is incredible. Their simple, yet tasty, roasted garlic is always a must with me as well. Salads are top notch, daily specials always mouth watering, and it's just a warm atmosphere to be a part of. The manager is supremely nice and recognizes you after just one visit. Every waiter I've had has been the picture of great service and I can't think of one bad dish I've been served. Parking can sometimes be a bit tricky, but there is a large lot across the street that you can use. It's a great place to take out-of-towners, a date, or your parents.",5-star
"I want to start out by saying, the reason I am giving this restaurant a 4 is because the service and ambiance. The food was just alright. We started with the cheese curds and they were yummy. For dinner I had the chicken and waffles and my husband ordered the meat loaf special. I did not care for the breading on the chicken and the waffles were heavy and bland. My husband enjoyed his meal and said he would order it again. We will definitely give this place another try.",4-star
Fantastic cheese curds and Brussels sprouts. What an adorable place. Stopped here for appetizers before the d'backs game and definately coming back for dinner.,5-star
"Went here for my husband and I's anniversary dinner and we fell in LOVE! Not a great place to bring kids but trust me you will ENJOY spending time there with your friends or your spouse! We tried EVERYTHING but I love, LOVE the skirt steak!!!!",5-star
"To say that this place was a disappointment is an understatement. We have tried unsuccessfully two times before to go there for dinner. Tonight we were successful but regretted it afterwards. We ordered two bourbon and their homemade citrus soda that were the bomb!! We sat down at our table after about a 20 min wait which wasn't bad. Our server Craig seemed super rushed right from the start, which is just annoying. We were a little limited to what we could eat because we don't eat cheese but we started with the chicken pot pie. Which was good but it really could have been fabulous. There just wasn't enough veggies. I ordered the lamb meatballs with spaghetti squash and my bf ordered the special pork ribs with sweet potato fries. We also ordered the brussel sprouts. This is where it really went wrong. I get my food and we wait 12 minutes for my boyfriends. Mine was ice cold by time he got his. We got a sorry but as I said our server seemed rushed when we sat down and it never got better. As far as flavor my bf's was great except the fries and cornbread were cold. Mine was just ok. I ate half and honestly I wouldn't have eaten it the next day if I had loved it. The flavor was just so so. It needed a little spice. We ordered the triple chocolate mousse cake and I honestly think Betty Crocker and my old school easy bake oven could have done better. We told the server that we didn't care for it and it wasn't what we expected. The server did take it off the bill but honestly after the chef screwed up our dinner as badly as he did its the least he could have done. So yeah we won't be returning",2-star
"The Tuck Shop website does not do it justice. I looked at the website (mainly at the menu) when my boyfriend suggested the restaurant. I wasn't sure what kind of place it was I thought it might have been a divey type place with a good menu. That was the impression I got from the style and quality of the website at least. I don't know I just think all black with high saturated colors say lack of class. Well anyway that is not what the Tuck Shop is like at all! It is a wonderful comfortable and elegant restaurant. We ordered three apps and one small plate that we shared. The Brussel sprouts, stuffed dates, pork and tomato jam sandwich, and the pot pie. Every thing was seasoned well. The dates and sandwich get five stars. We love our Brussel sprouts but would not order them again. They seemed a little over cooked to our liking and the burnt onion kind of overwhelmed all the flavors. It was a little dark and until my last few bites I didn't realize there were nuts in the dish. The Chicken pot pie was good, except for the fact they put a sprig of rosemary in it for garnish and the rosemary kinda took over all the flavors. The Ginger Ale tasted like a gingerbread cookie and was not the refreshing beverage that I hoped for. The dates were awesome, sweet and succulent with a great chorizo stuffing. The sandwich had no flaws as well. It had perfectly cooked broccoli (another fave of ours) and a fantastic cheese sauce on the plate as well. The one thing that stopped me from giving Tuck Shop five stars was the service. I observed that it seemed to just be our waiter. I observed the other waiter and he was spot on. As we were seated I heard him asking for another tables drink order and he advised of what the house specials were and told them of the house brewed ginger ale. I was very interested. When our waiter came for our drink orders he just asked what we wanted to drink. I paused waiting to hear everything available and he just looked at us. We ordered the ginger ale. The waiter stopped at our table several times to fill our water and never asked us how everything was. We were feeling a little ignored. Our empty plates stacked up a bit as well. The same thing happened when it was time for the desert order as the drink order. He asked if we wanted desert and just looked at us. Then he questioned if we wanted desert again. And we said we don't know what do you have. He offered two deserts and we declined. Service was strange and I observed the other waiter and he seemed to get what he was supposed to do. Maybe it was us, maybe we were dressed too casual? Maybe we had horrible breath or BO?Maybe the waiter has never really worked at a nice restaurant? Great place would not hesitate taking anyone there. Great for a first date. They have a great communal table. And we were out the door at $50.00.",4-star
"The fundamentals that produce great food in a restaurant will result in loyal customers that will go anywhere to enjoy it. Here is a perfect example of just that. Tuck Shop is nestled in the historic Cornado district and is surrounded by homes. No major cross roads, no traffic that can see it. Yet when you do find this place and notice the details in the entry way followed by the modern decor you know you are somewhere different. The restaurant seats maybe 60 people and has a great cocktail lounge to relax before you get seated for what is to come. Feel like reading, or playing a game just look at the neighboring shelf and you might just find it. For drinks start off with some good craft beer or have some of their cocktails which they have several mixes that are awesome. We started the evening off with the Baguette, my wife is a big garlic nut so we couldn't resist. Next came Brussels Sprouts that to be honest are not something I eat regularly but here, bring it all day. For dinner I cheat and order for two but why not this place is worth it! For starters the Mac and Cheese is AMAZING! They even give it somewhat toasty flare with the proscuitto, sizzling! YUM Next we finish off with an order of Lamb Meatballs and my wife orders her favorite Chicken and Waffles which btw I will not say this too loud but probably are the best in town. Desert? If you have room get a illy espresso and their desert bite that can vary depending on the day, me thinks. Enjoy and believe me this place is it.",5-star
"On a Friday night this place is alive and vibe'n. It's small and intimate with a wide variety of people. The dim lighting and chill music was the perfect setting for an end of the week dinner. We had to wait for about 30 minutes for a table to open up, but in the meantime the lovely bartender made an aw-wesome margarita, and I am very picky about my margaritas... There's a long table in the middle of the room for a large group, surrounded by several smaller tables. I was actually pleasantly surprised with how nice and comfortable this place was considering it's kind of in an odd location. We munched on the ""Pasta Fries"" that came with a raspberry jam-like dip and a feta cheese sauce dip. It was all a very weird combination (beer battered pasta, really?) but it was REALLY good. I loved it! I'd totally go back just for the margarita and pasta fries! Mmmm. We ended our food adventure with the mac and cheese with ""lobstah."" This I didn't like so much. The lobster was too fishy for the mac and cheese, but with out it, it probably would have all been awesome. I needed another margarita after that one :)",4-star
"Sadly I'm going to rate this restaurant based on my recollection of Homemade Ginger Ale and Fried Cheese Curds... maybe I should stop now... Hmm. Location, Food, Ambience - neat little place. I eat at plenty of places but rarely two months later can a recall anything specifically about the experience, but Tuck Shop had fried cheese curds... really good fried cheese curds - I was in Wisconsin for a while so I've had my share, and these were probably the best I've had - usually you just end up with a fried cheese stick but here they did the cheese curd justice - and then you get some tasty home brewed ginger ale to wash it down... Yeah, Ginger Ale and Fried Cheese Curds... Hmm, I probably shouldn't have written this...",5-star
"I visited here again in September and was wowed once more. The service is great, everyone is very friendly and they take the time to talk with you and truly seem to be interested in what you have to say.

I have been here countless times since my last review and found myself here for a quick drink and some appetizers last night. I took a huge hiatus as I was in Michigan for a month and then have been crazy busy since arriving back in Phoenix and transitioning into a new job- I was sad because I thought they would've forgotten me. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they did not forget me at all. I love that! We grabbed some brews and shared the patatas bravas (a personal favorite) and the mushroom appetizer. The mushroom appetizer was heavy on the cheese but still a tasty bite. The patatas bravas really never fail- they remind me of my Mom's version of french fries. I'd highly recommend this place for a date- it seems to pay off in more ways than one. Always great service and interesting eats- still lovin' Tuck Shop for being in my neighborhood!,5-star
"Aptly named!! It is tucked away and uniquely designed. The food is meant to be shared FORGET THAT right now, it's not enough, but GOOD. The best thing I found here was the H2O.

Ordered a couple of take out fish sandwiches last evening at my daughter's recommendation. Half way through I took a bite and got a large hair ball with it. It was disgusting.

"One of my go to places to go to in the area. After today though I probably won't go back again. I don't think the kitchen can keep up with the busyness. It was a busy night but it took over 40 minutes to get a Reuben, tuna melt, and meatball hoagie. As soon as the food came we had to ask for boxes. Even though we had somewhere to go, we thought we would've had plenty of time. The waitresses seemed miserable and it's probably because they had to deal with the complaints of the wait. I felt bad for them because it wasn't their fault. They also changed the menu and replaced the pizza with flatbreads and the home cut fries with beer battled ones.",2-star

"I've been visiting the twin oaks two or maybe three times a month since I moved to the area. I would like to say, my first five or six expedience were fine. I went in this evening with my wife, she got the eggplant parmesan, me, hot meatloaf sandwich. My wife was satisfied with her meal, as was I, until I found a bread tie in my mouth. A plastic coated, wire bread tie. I don't know if it was inside the meatloaf, or between the bread and meatloaf, never the less, I found it while chewing. I calmly got the waitress attention, told and showed her, I even shushed her when she exclaimed ""oh my God!"". She asked if I wanted it remade, I declined, she was nice and apologetic, possibly embarrassed. A few minutes later she returned with my bill, she took off the meatloaf. I think, if the Oaks wanted to retain a local, regular guest, they would have taken everything off my bill. To be fair, the appetizer was fine, wife's eggplant was fine, the two cokes were fine, so I guess it was fine, I just won't be back. Sorry Oaks, we're 3 months into a 30 year mortgage, you really should have tried a little to keep a local customer.",1-star
"Appetizers are half off on Wednesdays, which is an excellent deal, you get a ton of food. Wait staff is very friendly, and service was good. Portions are very large, and there is always a lot to take home. Try the chicken Philly and the nachos grande",5-star
Best place in the world to gather with friends. Have never found better wings anywhere and we have looked everywhere around the country. Sometimes we crave their Reuben sandwich.,5-star
"Food was good, my husband got the steak sandwich and he said it was one of the best he's ever had. The meat was real steak, not generic steakum meat. I got seasoned wings, they were slightly overcooked but seasoned well. Service was terrible. I would probably not go back just for that reason. Waitress moved like a snail, didn't bother to check on us or refill drinks. Not very friendly. They need to train their staff a little better.",3-star
"Apps are good, food portions are large and reasonably priced, service is fast and friendly Correction, some of the service is friendly...Mel and Mel are fantastic",3-star
"My husband loves their blackened wings. Just okay and sloppy to me. As for their famous homemade chips, every time I've ever gotten them there were burnt and tasteless",2-star
"Typical bar food. Wings here were quite good, as they were the whole wing. That was the only highlight I experienced. Be prepared to walk through a smoke filled bar before you go to the dining room area. Really bad service. Although we had a new waitress, she wasn't even friendly. Screwed up orders and everything was super slow, and just unprofessional. I have no reason to ever go back.",2-star
"They have 2 dining rooms to choose from and a bar that is usually full. Take out orders are filled pretty quickly, and I'm impressed with the low prices and extra large portions. The service staff is friendly, but never perfect. The fare is your typical suburban family oriented bar menu. The portions are HUGE, so if you are hungry and stuck in White Oak, this is the place to go. I wish there were more appetising healthy choices on the menu. I don't know why everyone is so impressed with the home made potato chips; every time I have had them they were overdone and tasted of old grease. Really could have been MUCH better.",2-star
"My wife and I go here about once a week on average. The food is good at a reasonable price. I come from a small town, so this place makes me feel at home. The food is good, the homemade chips are unique and pretty tasty. I often get the Nacho Grande, which is like eating a field of vegetables covered in nacho chips and sprinkled with a dash of ground beef. For $7.99 it is very worth the money. If you looking for a cozy place to grab a drink and get some food, this is it.",4-star
"Typical bar food with mediocre service; one of the few ""bar/restaurants"" that are available among the area in which it's located. I *want* to like this place because it's local and privately owned (non-chain/non-franchised) and so close to home, !but the service keeps turning me off. Of all of the times that I've been there, I only had good service twice. The one time, the guy that waited on us went to school with me. The second time, I was there with a group for a meeting and the lady was very nice to us! Overall, I'd give them a chance to redeem themselves (on service) because they do have some winning food products here. PROS: Convenient location appears clean food is consistent Large menu!!!!!!! :) Menu/Food specials/features Sunday-Saturday CONS: 1.) Bathrooms are a bit sketchy 2.) Service is very mediocre 3.) They gave my husband a nasty rusty can of Miller Lite! WTF is up with that? No bottles of miller lite AND they served up the NASTIEST RUSTIEST can they could find??!? ...ught-uh! 4.) The Bartender staff does not warm up to anyone other than regulars which is crazy because you live off of tips when you're a bartender, not that stinky per hour wage!!! There are no bad shifts, just bad bartenders! I've been there on several occasions and the bartender's were the worst. Sit @ a table!!! The customers were nice--a couple of regulars chummed right up to us and were very nice and chatty with us for about an hour before we were so thirsty that we had to leave because another bev was clearly NOT in our future here. TIPS: Order the Sweet Potato Fries--they are quite yummy!!!!!!! :) PRICING: low, to mid-range $$ PARKING: shared lot in Rainbow Shopping Plaza WAITRESS: yes FULL BAR AVAILABLE GOOD FOR GROUPS: Yes GOOD FOR KIDS: @ the tables, yes ACCEPTS CREDIT CARDS:: yes ATTIRE: casual OUTDOOR SEATING: no http://www.twinoakslounge.com/",2-star

"The low rating is not for food, but service and attitude. Four of us went there on a Monday evening. The food was good, we each enjoyed what we ordered. But the service was very slow, and there were not even that many customers there. We were seated at the booth on the far end of the restaurant. Also, mistakes were made on our credit cards. When I went back (twice) to try to get the credit card charge corrected, I was encouraged to just dispute the charge on my card. No offer of help, even with attitude. I prefer to take my business someplace else.",2-star
"One Star is being far too generous. The WORST!!! Do not waste your money on this restaurant establishment. My friend and I had a Filet Mignon. The steak knife they gave me would not cut soft butter. When I asked for another one, The manager gave me tremendous attitude and told me they are all alike and then proceeded to come by with a basket full of steak knives and drop them next to me at the table and told me to pick one with a belligerent attitude. I told him I have never been treated so poorly in a very nice restaurant. He did not seem to care one bit, as a matter of fact, he became more aggressive throwing the check in the billfold on the table. Then to add insult to injury the waitress came by to check on our table, when I expressed to her my complaint he became verbally abusive to me. The owner of this restaurant needs to get his shit together with this poor representation of what he calls management is unacceptable. I would not treat a dog the way this man treated me. He needs to be fired and sent to a Third World country where he cannot have interaction with anybody as he clearly has no people skills!",1-star

We waited over an hour for the food to come after we ordered . The waiter was not very apologetic or very attentive. Our wait clouded our whole experience so it was hard to enjoy the food when it finally came.,2-star
To start the waiter was curt and not friendly.on saturday night they were out of. veal dish and no desserts except pudding. At 630pm. The place was busy how can that happen. I find both kinda bizzarre.no bread or salad comes with dinner The calamari was nicely done. The server were dressed terrible..one had old jeans that were ragged. Another wearinf a hunting coat .server never asked if we wanted coffee just layed our check on table and left,2-star
The Wellington was AMAZING!! The goat cheese ravioli was delicious and the shrimp cocktail was huge and definitely two thumbs up. The cheese and meat board however was not worth the money though.,5-star
"Good good. Poor service. Dirty surfaces (tables, chairs, floors, menus, etc..Wait staff dressed in old, dirty t-shirts. Weird location. Outdated decore. Tried this place three times hoping things would improve (I always support local venues first) Sadly, they didn't. Owner responded to my honest review by insulting me and dropping the F bomb. Classy guy. Seems he should focus more on improving his restaurant rather than chasing away customers.",1-star
"We have been here twice for drinks and dinner, made reservations on open table, they seem a little confused when checking in, but when you finally get to your table the staff in quick to wait on you with great service and food, I would highly recommend this restaurant, there food was great and the drinks where made perfect!",5-star
"Was in with my family over the weekend on saturday. Food was excellent. Service was pretty good, but was very very busy. We had a tall, very skinny waitress, she had a bit of an attitude and seemed annoyed. My husband kept referring to her as ""twiggy"". only thing would recommend, is a different server. The african american server who checked on us was very nice. Would like to have him next time. Other than that, everything was great!",5-star
"I didn't know what to expect. I went with my department for a work lunch and it turned out they had a completely separate began menu that was loaded with entrees - many or most of which were gluten free. I tried the tempeh lasagna and loved it. A co-worker had the tempeh noodles and I got to try them. They were phenomenal. I went last week so I could have the tempeh noodles myself. I have a new restaurant to are to my favorites list. Everyone else also enjoyed their meals. The flavor was spectacular and the service is top notch. I cannot wait to go back or order to go from there again soon. Also, there was so much food, I had enough for another full lunch serving so the cost per serving for me was cut in half. This place is a winner!",5-star
Ambiance is great for a date night. Drinks are fabulous. Staff have been so attentive to our needs; we had 4 people check on us the first 10 minutes. Great patio outside and the inside is beautiful. They also have cigars! I loved the chocolate and the espresso martinis.,5-star
"Village Martini and Wine Bar is definitely a hidden gem in Chagrin Falls. While the service is slow and the food is pricey, it's a great place for a romantic date or Saturday night dinner. My boyfriend and I both ordered the stuffed peppers for an appetizer (spicy yet delicious) and the baseball filet (so tasty and filling)!",4-star
This is another tucked in place in Chagrin. They have a nice bar and a menu that is very vegetarian friendly. The service was prompt and lunch was fabulous. I ordered a vegetarian pita and I was impressed. They also have quite a large wine selection. I have gone there in the summer and they have a nice patio for outside dining. It's a nice alternative to the Chagrin Falls Main St. Restaurants.,5-star
"I would probably give 3 stars for the food, but I'm bumping it up 1 star because they have a large vegan menu, and a nice atmosphere. They also have a decent cocktails along with a good beer selection. Went here for dinner last night with the husband and sister and while the husband is far from vegan, he ordered off of the vegan menu because it sounded better than the regular menu. We started off with tempeh fritters and the stuffed hungarian peppers. Both were very tasty, however the fritters weren't fritters, just strips of tempeh. Still, they tasted good. The stuffed hungarian pepper was very good and had a nice heat to it. For dinner, the husband ordered the chickpea meatballs with pasta and we all thought that it was very good. The sister had the tempeh lasagna which was really just tempeh, spinach and pasta sauce. It tasted good, but needed salt and maybe another texture (a noodle would help). I ordered the tempeh noodles which were a bit too sweet, but good nonetheless. My main complaint is that they rely a bit too much on tempeh and maybe they should try another type of vegetarian protein. Still, it is really nice to have a well thought out vegan menu in Chagrin Falls. Of note, they are a sister restaurant to Clifton wine and martini bar near Lakewood.",4-star
Great place. Love that they are vegan-friendly and have an entire vegan menu. I would suggest they place it on the tables like normal so you don't have to ask for it though. The happy hour drinks are great prices (& half price apps). The drinks are delicious and the food is amazing quality. Their vegan pizza is incredible. Have had friendly staff too. I definitely recommend this place.,5-star

"My wife and I ate dinner at the Village Martini and Wine Bar on August 25, 2015. We had a wonderful time! The atmosphere is quiet and refined. There are outside tables but it was cool so we ate inside. We started out with Martinis (naturally). We chose to eat ""Tapas"" style ordering several items off the appetizer menu so we could all try multiple items. This worked out really well! We had a total of 6 appetizers for the 4 of us. Our favorites were the duck wings and the Yellowfin Tuna. Fantastic. The Calamari was also great with a nice spicy sauce. The scallops were good as were the spring rolls although they were more like egg rolls. The Crab cakes didn't quite match up with the other items... The service was great! So, overall, for a quiet, upscale dinner with for the most part excellent food, we recommend this spot!",4-star
"The Village Martini and Wine Bar in Chagrin Falls is a cozy and quaint little bar/restaurant that is tucked back a bit from East Washington Street. I like to call it ""Chagrin Fall's best kept secret."" Upon entering the building complex in which the martini bar is in, you get transformed into pure ecstasy with the aromas of tea tree and other essential oils from another office that occupies the same building down the hallway. Managers Adam and Amber are AWESOME! Here is a place you will ALWAYS get good fresh made to your liking food, great service, and wonderful atmosphere. Cute little fireplace inside and a beautiful patio outside. Dark, quaint and quiet bar with two televisions. Their seasonal in-house infused vodkas are a must try!! Best happy hour around!!!! My #1 Favorite place!!!!",5-star
Apparently I have struck a nerve with someone as he has called me an idiot. I did not realize that if I left MY opinion in MY food for that day someone named Jeff would stoop to such a level.

"Loved finding this place while visiting Solon for work! Great drink selection & reasonable portion size all for a great price. The food was delicious and my dinner companion loved his meal, Pad Thai with chicken! Very unassuming as it's tucked away in a small indoor shopping plaza. Loved the hospitality also.",5-star
"Went for dinner and drinks with some friends. Parking was crowded, in a shared business lot. Nice atmosphere. Menu had many different things to offer from salads, steaks and pasta dishes. Service was good. Our server made wine recommendations and even brought over a sample of what was recommended. Food came out fast and was hot. We didn't have dessert but saw another table eating something chocolatey and it looked as good as our meals were. Prices were moderate. Bathroom was located in hallway and was cold and dirty, it is shared with other businesses in the building. I would go back. Overall experience was good!",4-star
"So disappointed in the service here. When we walked in, we felt like we were inconveniencing the server. He practically threw the menus on the table and barely spoke to us. Basic services were ignored so we had to go to the bartender, who was awesome! The food and drinks were great! The server was just so rude, that it was hard to get over.",2-star
Not sure what the hoopla is about this place. Any place that has less than 15 martinis on their menu should not advertise that theyre a martini bar. $9 martinis. They weren't filled to the rim and lacked garnish. They do have a great outside patio area for eating/drinking. We watched the waitress clearing tables outside tossing all the left over glasses of water towards the plants steps away from another table of prople. Plastic cheap menus. Hostess didnt say goodbye. Just not impressed.,2-star
"Wow! Went here last weekend at the suggestion of a friend. She ordered a chocolate martini while I had one of the seasonal drinks that I just can't recall the name of!! It had strawberry puree, cucumber vodka, and was so refreshing. Both drinks were delicious, in fact. I've heard many good things about their pomegranate martini as well, so that's next on my list to try.",4-star
"From the outside, this restaurant is unassuming, and my guess is that if you didn't know it existed, you would drive on by. But that would be a huge mistake. Everything my husband and I ordered was saliva-inducing delicious. The crab cakes were divine--not too ""fishy"" and accompanied with a fresh red pepper coulis and cold corn salsa. I ordered the Ohio Berkshire Pork Chop, which was wonderfully moist and featured a maple sauce--the perfect combination of salty and sweet. My husband chose the Pittsburgh Steak and loved it, a bit surprising as he typically likes everything plain, plain, plain, and this piece of meat is rubbed with spices and served with hot peppers, olives, tomatoes and a red sauce. The steak was grilled to a precise medium rare, just as he ordered it. The service is just a tad slow, unless you're a regular. The waitstaff obviously had their favorites, but, still, we didn't feel slighted. Expect to pay $18-20/per entree unless you plan on just ordering a sandwich. I would recommend reservations, especially if you have a large party; we were able to get a seat right away, but we arrived just as they opened at 5 p.m. on a Saturday. The restaurant is small, and it filled up quickly. This is a great spot for a romantic date or a family dinner.",5-star
Usually have appetizers and drinks. Service is good. Yellowfin is fabulous. Mango scallops and proscuitto are also great. Good wine list. Outdoor seating is comfortable.,5-star
"Village just keeps getting better! I love how they change their menu! Gives me a variety of new options to try every few months. As of right now the Beef Wellington Short Ribs are my favorite!!! So tender and wrapped in the most flaky delicious pastry! Ugh, to die for. Also loving the new addition to the martini list - the Himalayan. Just the right amount of sweet!",5-star
Great food and service. Busy but not so loud you cannot talk with your friends. Great draft beer and mixed drink menu. A very interesting food menu as well. Everything we had was fresh and well done. Probably one of the best kept secrets in Chagrin Falls. I will definitely be back!,4-star
"Made reservations here for Valentine's Day and when we got there, the hostess tried seating us in a crammed corner, cafeteria style. Another couple was way too close to us. We asked to be moved and the staff was hesitant about seating us elsewhere since they expected to be busy that evening, but we were moved and the food came out quickly. The French onion soup was very filling and the mojito's were refreshing. The entrees were kind of bland and small and i don't think they're quite worth the high price, to be honest. This place is a tad bit on the pricey side so i would save a trip back here for a more special occasion.",3-star
Very good food and great service from Ryleigh! The food was freshly made and hot! Everything tasted great and was cooked the way it was ordered! We will be back!,5-star
"Prompt and friendly service with great food. Our book club meets here a few times throughout the year and each time the food gets better (or my choices get better!) Servers are always attentive, cheerful, and keep the drinks and water flowing. I was initially skeptical of the price of the wild mushroom chicken, but was thoroughly impressed when my entree showed up. The portion was generous and soothed my hangry soul. I've done the pick a pair in the past, but in the future the entree is definitely worth the price! The garlic mashed potatoes had the perfect amount of garlic for this ""everything could use garlic person."" I'm still thinking about them..... The caesar salad, was....as expected a caesar salad. Great selection of beers on draft! Definitely a worthy option for a meal if in the area!",4-star
"Perfect Friday night dinner with my girlfriends. The space is huge! The bar area was fairly crowded. We didn't wait at all to be seated. It also looks like they have a big bar/patio area out front for the summer months. Our server was prompt and went over all of the specials. You'll have a button on your table you. An press anytime you need the server. We didn't have to use it as our server was prompt without being pushy. It has a very larger drink selection. I love the Narcisi wines. I recommend the peach moscato. They also had a $3 draft beer and $4 Tito's vodka drinks specials. It appears they run drinks specials every day of the week. At our table we started with the fried zucchini planks. They were good, nothing special. For dinner I had the Balsamic Chicken. Excellent portion. It comes with two pieces of chicken, a side and the daily vegetable. I ordered the sweet potato which came with cinnamon butter. If you check in you'll receive a free Walnut Ball. I'm allergic to nuts, but my friends enjoyed it! Will be back. Looking forward to summer months on the patio!",4-star
"Came for the Sunday lunch buffet. Had your usual pancakes, waffles, and salad along with roast beef, mushroom chicken, and some other random items. Honestly, everything was pretty room temperature and tasted ok. I think the buffet was a bad choice because the other people we were with ordered food and they said it was pretty good. I'd give it another shot but definitely not at the buffet.",2-star
Enjoyed a dinner of fish tacos and a mojita with a friend celebrating her birthday. The servers and service was good. We ate outside and the patio was pleasant. It was a great evening to eat outside. I would definitely go back again.,5-star
I have been to this establishment a few of times and I am sure I will be visiting again in the future.

I haven't visited their other locations but I guess they should be equally good!,4-star
"This was our first visit for dinner, with a group of our neighbors. Food was excellent much better than expected. I had the parmesan encrusted chicken with gnocchi . tomato basil sauce...was excellent! My companions also enjoyed their selections Good menu, with many options. Something for everyone! I am a craft beer lover, choices were very limited. Wine was ok, but not bad. Service was very good...we will try them again...worth the price...",5-star
"What an experience! We had reservations but upon arrival the hostess seemed lost in finding our name. After 10 minutes of standing around, we were seated at a table for 6 (there were only 4 of us). No sooner than they took our drink order, the manager came and asked us to move to a different table. We had to start the ordering process all over again with a different server making us feel as if they were trying to shoehorn us in and had no clue of our reservation. It took an hour to receive our meals and the restaurant was not over busy. We never received our complimentary bread even though the server mentioned it twice to us that is was coming. A second glass of wine was ordered to pair with dinner and it arrived after the meal was already complete. One guest in our party did not receive the side she ordered but we didn't want to send it back to the kitchen. We had plans for the night and did not want to be late. Overall the service seemed slow compared to the other tables around us. The manager checked in on other tables to ask about their dining experience but avoided coming over to our table. We did not feel welcomed and will not be back to this location.",2-star
"VERY good experience. The food was great and they kindly offer a very generous military discount to our Vets, which is greatly appreciated. While the food did take a little too long to come out, it was amazing once it got there. The apricot salmon was the best fish I've had in the burgh. Friendly staff, warm atmosphere, and great food; what more could you ask for? Strongly recommend.",5-star
"Our first time going last night. I'm really clueless how this place has the reviews it does. We started off with the calamari. It was terrible, literally the worst tasting calamari I've ever had. The only decent part of it was the tangy sauce they have to dip with which I used to kill the taste of the calamari with. I ordered the crab cakes with a loaded baked potato and the brussel sprouts. The most worst crab cakes ever!! There was no breading at all. It was terrible tasting crab with mayonnaise pretty much and just fell apart. The brussel sprouts were hard as a rock and I didn't care for them. The only good part was the baked potato. My boyfriend ordered the catch of the day which was wahoo with a mango relish, the daily vegetable (slaw) and rice pilaf. The fish was extremely small for $20+ dollars and he said it just tasted like pepper and had a teaspoon of the relish on it. The slaw was literally bagged slaw on the plate with no sauce and the rice was extremely overdone and mush. Our kids got the chicken tenders and pizza with fries. The chicken and pizza looked decent and both kids ate but the fries tasted like oil. On the positive part our service had to be the best out of all the times we have ate out in the past 2 years which I did compliment the waitress with. I would never come back again though due to the food.",1-star
This one star is for the two orders we returned. The cheesesteak sandwich was allegedly prime rib sliced thin and it was raw when I bit into it. Outside seared but the inside just thawing pre-sliced unknown cut of beef. That is how I saw that the beef was not marbled sliced prime rib. The glutamate was not released from the protein by proper cooking of thin sliced beef and the blood from the thawing part suggested hemolysis of the blood from refereeing. The Reuben's sandwich had two slices of marbled rye that were not equally toasted on the griddle. The staff was trying to pass off the inconsistency of the bread as that of the marbling in the dough. Rather than immediately offering a redo of the dishes it took a manager to decide the return. Half an hour to wait for food. From time order was taken.,1-star
"Unfortunately, the Wexford location has turned back to a appetizer and drink only place again. Poor service, food served was cold. Strangest looking french onion soup, two.pieces of bread thrown into the bowl like an after thought. Disappointing...",1-star

"Wow! First time at the Walnut Grill and it exceeded my expectations. I was coming to celebrate a friend's birthday - my group didn't meet the minimum to reserve the party room, but that wasn't a big deal. Plenty of parking which was great. For appetizers we got the calamari and the lobster Mac and cheese. Both were delicious but we did find a hair in the Mac and cheese, we got a replacement but the waiter did NOT take it off the check. This was a unpleasant surprise (why I gave four stars). For dinner we got the Pittsburgh flatbread, Spinach and Artichoke flatbread, smoked salmon salad, strawberry chicken salad, buffalo chicken wrap, and classic cheeseburger. The flatbreads were HUGE and cooked to perfection. Fries were delicious and the salads were hearty. Will definitely be returning again for lunch or dinner!",4-star

"Been to Walnut Grill 4 or 5 times and owe it a review. One of the best food and drink Happy Hours in the Wexford and North Hills area for sure, especially when the weather allows patrons to enjoy the spacious patio. Happy Hour here, at least in the summertime, is a popular spot, but we've actually never had an issue being seated on the patio--and thank goodness for the huge parking lot. Love that there are $3 glasses of wine during Happy Hour. A $3 decent chilled Riesling on the patio in the summer...I'm game. My guy is a fan of the wine deals too and also likes the great bang-for-buck Happy Hour beer specials. There are cocktail specials as well, though I haven't dabbled in those. Happy hour food is just as good. Our go-to appetizers/small plates are the black tip shark bites (love 'em so much I make my husband order his own so that I don't have to share) and the really chunky and substantial spinach and artichoke dip (comes with loads of tortilla chips and seasoned crackers). Summer days are fading fast. I recommend heading to Walnut Grill for Happy Hour on the patio before it's too late.",5-star
"We had our engagement party here 2 years ago and the managers I worked with were very nice and made everything within the budget without compromising the quality and quantity of the food. We had the wild mushroom chicken, parmesan crusted chicken, a beef dish and a fish dish. We got the brownie works for dessert, which is one of the reasons why we chose this place for our engagement bc brownie sundaes is our thing. The only thing about that party was that they had one server for our party of 25. Anyway, I do frequent this place for the food and happy hour. It's nice in warmer weather where they open the outdoor patio and have a bar outside. The strawberry bellini-tini is delicious. They have a daily drink special and it's also one of the ony places that have firefly sweet tea vodka. I recommend this place although they really need to do something about the parking lot because there are times when it's so crowded that I get turned off to stay. Service is also inconsistent.",4-star
"{Have to start by saying this is the Rt 19 location!! Had an awful food / server experience at the Waterworks location. Foolishly since I'd come to the North Hills WG before and loved it, I assumed the other location would be great too}, Such chic fun interior and interesting menu! Our Server Scott, in spite of a lonnng day (I asked, he didn't whine about it) was efficient, and professional-style friendly. Not like the well meaning Server who thinks ""friendly"" means you came to share the eve with them in conversation, you've met them, right? Anyway, let's move on to food, that's why we go to Restaurants, right? And yet...ALL of the above matters in the experience, otherwise we'd go get hot food at Giant Eagle! Best. Roast.Beef. Sandwich. EVER. (Umm, I get them a lot!) Prime rib was well trimmed, with a ton of perfectly carmelized onions, and fresh sautéed mushrooms, generous pepperoncini, lavish amount of provolone, on an excellent baguette...for my side, I chose freshly grilled veggies, yummy. Just right crispness. Hubby loved his Pittsburgh style Chicken salad, fresh, fresh, and with freshly made Ranch dressing. When we have twice loved a location, we feel confident it's not a fluke, but a great place. Our first visit was super good food & service too, and when the manager made the rounds to check on our experience, she was genuinely interested. And ""comped"" us a free round of Cocktails!!! That never happens, wish I'd have review then, but hadn't been Yelping then...",5-star

We will surely be returning to this place.",4-star
"I came here for an engagement party and our group was given a private room near the back of the restaurant. The service was good considering there were 20 people in our party. The only complaint would be when the waitress brought out everyone's dessert but never brought utensils. My only complaint about the food is that there are no healthy options on the menu. We were allowed to select a steak, chicken or fish entree from a special pre-printed menu. Each dish description sounded good (and relatively healthy) until you actually received your food. Everything with the exception of the steak was breaded and cooked in butter. I could smell it from a mile away. My chicken with wild mushroom dish was extremely heavy and not what I expected. Overall, nice restaurant but the food could use some improvement.",3-star
"We had reservations for brunch before wedding dress shopping (note to self - next time avoid a buffet brunch before trying on wedding dresses). We were seated immediately and were SUPER excited to see the Bloody Mary checklist. They had so many awesome ingredients that you could add! Our server gave us the checklists, but no pens. After about 10 minutes of waiting, we asked another server for some pens so we could make our selection. Two of us got medium and one got mild. Our server didn't return to take our drink orders for quite a while (the overall theme was that he was super nice but not particularly good at his job), and then our Bloody Marys didn't come for quite a long time. As in, we didn't have our drinks until we had been at the restaurant for about 45 minutes. When we got the Bloody Marys, they were CRAZY SPICY. I like a good amount of heat, but these were just too much. As in, take a sip and then chug water. We kindly asked for some extra tomato juice to tone down the spice, which our server provided. But even with the extra tomato juice, they were just too hot. Our sever later asked us if we enjoyed the cucumber vodka we upgraded to and then before we could answer said, ""Oh they are probably too spicy to taste the cucumber."" None of us drank more than 1/3 just because they were too hot to enjoy (and came out long after we wanted them). You'd think the server would offer to take them off the bill after he admitted they were really spicy, we said they were too spicy, and NONE of us drank them. But nope, no offer whatsoever. As far as the brunch buffet food goes, it was excellent. The bacon was very good quality. The made-to-order omelets were very good (they offered egg whites, which I appreciated) and they weren't huge, which is good when there are so many other offerings on the buffet to enjoy. My mom said the eggs benedict was very good, but I didn't try it. The bread pudding was awesome - some of the best I've had. Overall, the food was very good but the service and drinks really put a damper on our experience. I don't think I'd rush back simply for those reasons.",2-star
"My wife and I went there Sunday evening 5/5/13 around 6pm. Went to Hostess, requested outside seating and were seated right away. Restaurant not crowded at all. Sat at our table for a good 10+ minutes, no server came to take our drink or meal orders. Got the attention of a waiter, who informed us we were not his table, but he would take our drink order. Since we knew what we wanted to eat, we ordered food also. Another 10 to 15 minutes went by, still no drinks, food or server(s). We got up and went down the street to Bonnie and Clydes, had a great meal with good service there. We have been to Walnut Grove before and had decent service and meals. Now we will think twice about going again.",1-star
"The happy hour here is ok. Good drink specials and $5 appetizers. I had a Caesar Salad. There could have been 1-2 more ounces of chicken on it. It had about 4-5. It was a $13 dollar salad, and I think that was the cheapest one. I would go back, but only for the happy hour deals. No mores salads for me. I updated this. The food was ok for the happy hour. I was disappointed, but might be back. I might go to another establishment instead.",3-star
"Ok, takes a lot for me to write a bad review, but I have had it with this place. The last three times I ate a meal here it was simply awful. Most recent disasters were the Smoked Salmon Salad and something they tried to pass off as lasagne. The salad had some sort of salmon looking matter that had a phony smoke flavor added. Not smoked salmon like most would expect. And the dressing was lemon based but overly sour. The two bites I tried I this salad were the worst think I've ever tasted. The next was the horrid lasagne. It was some sort of attempt to re-imagine this classic dish. Not only was there too much cheese sauce that my daughter described as Mac and cheese like, but the bolognese sauce had some sort of odd spice that should not have been in this dish. Nutmeg perhaps? Regardless these meals were bad enough in and of themselves but to add insult to injury, these clowns charge outrageously high prices for garbage.",1-star

"Walnut Grove is one of my favorite places... not only is it easy to get to, it's a diamond in the rough! It's popular, it's chic and trendy, it's awesome food and friendly atmoshphere. We are regulars at ""The Grove"" and I try something different every time I go. I have not been disappointed. Every time, the service is friendly and responsive. It's a relaxing place to go and we default to going to the Grove more often than any other place! It's our go-to spot! Love Walnut Grove!",5-star
We went here Sunday night for our weekly family night out. We hadn't been here for over a year and we were pleasantly surprised. The beet salad was very tasty and my wife's steak was very tender. We'll definitely be back!,4-star
"Wow, great cool chill place ! It's a small place with just enough area for a decent stage, merch and a SRO area. No drama, no BS and only one patron that had a bit too much to drink(you know, the guy that drinks so much he has to take his shirt off..yeah that guy) ....it looked like he was irritating the band. Security promptly took care of it . It's so great to go to a place where no one has attitude . I noticed that a lot of shows don't have a cover . The show I went to was a staggering $10...for 5 great bands . If you're looking for great place for local and national acts this could be it . No pretentiousness, just great music . Just as a side note even with earplugs it was THUNDEROUS ! If I remember PBR was $2.50 . Tons of beer selections . Lots of parking . Security everywhere ..and couldn't be nicer . Update - I've been here a bunch of times now . Amanda and Ren are great . I finally went to the other side where you can eat . Tons of beers to choose from, taco Tuesday deals and Wednesday wings deals . The wings are out of bounds good and the ""hot"" is actually hot ! Great food while catching killer music - seriously, what else is there ?!",5-star

"Dingy, divey, dirty, and absolutely awesome are just some of the ways I would describe this intimate venue and bar in the east valley. I have attended 2 shows here and both times have been treated to packed houses that were electric with energy. I will definitely be a back for future shows and events.",5-star

"Yucca Tap Room is the perfect live music/divey hipster bar that the main bar strips like Mill and Old Town are always missing. The crowd reminds me of a mix of typical musicians and artists, as well as people who were probably teenagers attending the Warped Tour a decade or so ago. My favorite part of this bar is the live music, and that's exactly why we go. I can guarantee that on a Friday or Saturday night, there will be some bands playing and people rocking out here. The bartenders are really quick and they usually have some great craft beers rotating on draft. The Tap Room also has plenty of liquor options and they're prepared to cook bar food late into the night. The people I run into here are always pretty nice, and this is a bar I could see myself frequenting. The prices are also super reasonable for Tempe, especially at happy hour. I would recommend Yucca Tap Room to anyone who likes live music and doesn't mind a divey/grunge feel. Personally, I prefer it at times.",4-star
"Cheap drinks, very eclectic atmosphere. Between just chilling at a table or standing up and dancing to the live band, there's a slice of night life to suit whatever the need. Don't enter with high expectations. Take it for what it is and have a good time :)",4-star
I called to ask a question and whoever answered the phone was beyond rude! Literally said I'm busy and I don't have time to answer your question and then hung up on me. I will never waste my time or money at this please. Clearly not a place that cares about their customers.,1-star
"Music atmosphere was cool I'll give them that. Definitely not a very friendly place though. I go in late to watch a friend of my play a show and felt like I could have been stabbed anytime. You feel like an outsider if you don't go every night. The staff wasn't very professional and let random customers step behind the bar to do what they wish. Random music being playing in the off room by a loud DJ with no one dancing or even in the bar with Harry Potter movies being played on all the TVs. What kind of place is this? If they didn't have decent live music, I wouldn't see any women feeling convertible in here.",2-star
"I'm not in AZ very often, but when I am - this is THE place to meet friends and family (leave the kids at home)! Try one of the local brews after you've had your fill of PBR! Yucca has it all - good music, good food, good prices, good location and best of all - sans a cover charge! I'll be back when I'm back in town!",5-star
This place is awesome! One side has a DJ and a pool table with specialty beers you can order by name or number. The other side has a stage and live bands so you are just a door away from choosing which kind of atmosphere you would like. A mixed crowd of people but everyone for the most part seem to enjoy themselves. In the few times I have been there I have not seen any incidents there.The place has character for sure and drinks are reasonable. Well worth the look. My only gripe is the bathroom is single toilet and not so nice but I still give it 5 stars because everything else is so good.,5-star
"I have had intentions to come here for a long time. The reviews have been suspiciously good, and I felt that I needed to know why. But, it isn't all good so I will try provide the lay of the land. The good It's a two room bar that has both room and potential. It's a classic dive that gives a homey feel to regulars. They have a happy hour, but it is not needed due to the very reasonable prices on a normal night. Ex. I ordered a Captain and coke, and the lady asked me if I wanted a tall or a short. I ordered a tall and that was 5 bucks. Now you might ask, how much rum can there be in a $5 cptncoke, and I claim 'enough'. This impressed me so much that I stayed for another one. The other part of the bar have craft beers and I need to check that out on my next visit, because there will be a next visit for sure. The bartender lady was nice and clearly the caretaker of the regular day-drinkers. The bad I knew where this place was, and when I parked in the back I wasn't sure I wanted to go in. I didn't know if I wanted to park my car here. The people that roam this plaza is of the seedy type and that is not something I like. But this bar has been around for a long time, and I am sure that the area has changed during that time. I will give it the benefit of the doubt. The unknown I haven't been here late at night. I need to. I want to check out the true clientele of this place, and not just the time-passers. They have bands that play here, I don't know how good they are or how wild it gets. This is another thing I have to figure out.",4-star
"Great food and a good place to unwind, there is a pool table thats usually not being used but there is only one. Other than that they have incredible drinks, music, shows, and are really reasonably priced. Don't forget to grab a bite either, their food is surprisingly good.",4-star
"I am all about Yucca Tap Room. (Except your parking lot. It sucks. I feel like I almost always scrape my undercarriage of my car on those speed bumps because I forget they are there). Anyway...fun, live music, awesome service, and the ambiance, while dive bar-ish, is inviting. It's a cozy environment with two rooms to separate the bar/restaurant from the live entertainment. Let me tell you why I LOVE places that do this. I am a music fanatic. However, there are sometimes those days where you go somewhere, like Yucca, or any other food-serving bar for that matter, and you just want to eat. It's AWESOME that I can still watch the live entertainment on the televisions they have propped on the walls while still being able to hear my friends speak. Sometimes you just have to separate the ones who came for the show and the ones who came for the food. Speaking of the food. Bar food. I mean...how good is it going to actually get? At Yucca, I have the pleasure of saying, it actually gets pretty good. But it's still a bar... right? Yes. So the drink specials are quite comparable to other bars as well. I have to say, I do enjoy me some Yucca Tap Room. It is a place that I will continue to frequent providing I am in the area, or if I have a friend's band playing there and whatnot.",4-star
Huge expansion. Decent selection of foods! Huge selection of craft beers to add to their pre-tap days offerings. And plenty of live music without a cover (usually). All without sacrificing the dive bar atmosphere.,4-star
"Ok, so why does no one mention the ""Food""??? Must admit I'm in the older crowd... I like it on the early side, before the music starts... This place has been here forever, perfect spot for Friday nite dinner stop and CRAZY GOOD FOOD! Bacon Waffle Patty Melt w/ Tots and all dipped in Syrup! I love it! Definitely on the divey side, but shout out to ERIC in Security.. He will make you feel special and welcome! Check it out!!",5-star
"Yucca is a staple in my routine of dive-ish bars, and always entertaining for sure! Depending on the night the clientele can range from regulars, hip-hop heads, to metal heads and everything in between. Callan is one of two of my favorite bartenders there. Always so sweet, with a huge smile on her face and takes the time to make sure you get exactly what you want. My other favorite being Jared, what can i say, he makes a stiff drink and has more charm and charisma than the hoff.",4-star

Oh and try their pizza, delicious!",5-star

There is shuffle board and darts to keep you entertained between music sets. Even though the location is a little bit dumpy it adds to the dive bar factor and keeps the douschbags away.

"I'm a fan of Yucca. Clown Shoes is always fun to come sit in on. The music can be come and go, but at least there is plentiful amounts of it. It's usually pretty dark and there's always a crowd smoking outside. Nice and divey. Cash only, $2 PBR's in a can.",4-star
I make sure to stop in here every time i am in the Phoenix area. Great music and excellent service make this a place worth checking out for a few of their cheap drinks. Tuesday evenings a great house band called Chocolate Fountain will keep you grooving! Great local bands take turns filling the stage through out the rest of the week and weekend. Venus is one of the nicest bartenders in the valley and she will pour you an honest drink as will all the staff behind this bar. Oh yeah bar shuffleboard on hand for the sporty types.,5-star

"Yucca Tap Room! I love this place! I went on a Saturday night with an itch for shuffle board. When we walked in, I thought there was no way we'd get on the table with how crowded it was, but boy did we. We monopolized that table for what seemed like hours, playing with and against complete strangers and having a blast. A band was playing, which made for a great atmosphere but was not at all too loud for conversation-- a definite plus. I'll be going back very soon now that I've read about the live band karaoke!!",5-star

They looked at each other very puzzled I said do you have a happy hour from 9 until 10 ??? They still seemed very confused and were digging around under the desk I'm not quite sure what they were looking for, after another awkward 20 seconds I said never mind I was to tired to deal with a packed bar and confused employs........... mngt please inform your youthful people what a reverse happy hour is",1-star

"Have been here numerous times and previously loved the curry. Went this past Thursday during lunch. Wasn't too busy, but that's where things went downhill. We were quickly seated and given drinks. After reviewing the menu we had to flag the waiter to get orders taken. Ordered the lunch specials with salads. We waited for at least 30 minutes after ordering on salads which never came. Numerous tables were served as we continued to wait. Had to ask for an ice tea and water refill. After asking for food again we were told it's five more minutes. The bill was promptly placed on the table-with no compensation for wait. After more waiting we needed to leave for an appointment. We spoke to the waiter who said not to worry about the tea. As we left, we also explained our story to the person in charge. She asked if we had any thing to drink and then told us to pay for the ice tea. We explained that we didn't feel that we should after the service issues. She threatened to call the police on us! It doesn't seem that they have figured out the lunch service yet. Unfortunately, we will not be returning to a place that threatens us.",1-star
"This place was REALLY good!! i'm a big thai and asian food fanatic and it's hard to find good food sometimes! we had sashimi (very fresh!) and pad see ewe.

Great atmosphere with huge projection tvs. Very extensive menu, i am very excited to come back and try more items. Highly recommended",5-star
"This place is AMAZING. Everything that we ordered was absolutely delicious. A standout out and definite must have is the pineapple fried rice. It comes served in an actual pineapple and is great to share with everyone at the table. The prime rib eye soft, succulent and HUGE. In fact I think the best way to eat here is for everyone at your table to order something different and then just share everything. That way you can sample a little bit of everything from their very long list and varieties of food. Cocktails were scrumptious too. I can't remember the name of the one that comes to share that has a fire in the middle, but def delicious and makes for a good photo op too. They had a live soft jazz band the day and from what I understand they usually always do. The space itself is very beautiful as well too and laid out to accommodate parties of any size. When my family comes into town, I am definitely bringing them here. Hope this review was helpful. Enjoy ^___^",5-star

At first the location put us off a little, BUT the music is phenomenal and these guys play every night from 5:30-7pm, take requests and come and chat with you on their break, was a fun vibe. We enjoyed the outside seating and our food was excellent. I had the Salmon, my son had the Pad Thai and daughter the Pineapple Fried rice with chicken - the presentation was exquisite! We came away not having noticed the location, definitely tipping the musicians and fully satisfied! Give them a chance, we thoroughly enjoyed our evening!",5-star
"I looked forward to trying this new place in Scottsdale and last night called in an order for pick-up, ordering off the menu posted on their website. I won't be returning. While the hostess was very nice, the meal was a disaster. Upon arriving at the restaurant to pick up my order, the check was $10 more than expected, and when I questioned the price of two entrees I was asked ""What price did you see?"" and then told that they'd raised their prices about a month ago, but the changes to the menus ""hadn't been updated everywhere"". On their own website. The hostess adjusted the check, but I still felt it was rather ""bait & switch"". I then got home and discovered that the order was incorrect... I'd requested no nuts in the pineapple fried rice (tree nut allergy) and it had nuts. I'd ordered the spicy basil noodles.. but there were no noodles, but instead, rice. The servings were very small, really making the meal overpriced. After I called the restaurant, and spoke with the same hostess, I was told I could get a refund, as long as I drove back to the restaurant to return all the food! This, after being overcharged, and dishes being incorrect especially with a food allergy. I certainly was not happy. I did end up driving back the restaurant, with the food, because I decided my problem could be resolved (with a refund) far easier than the multitude of the restaurant's problems. I will not recommend this restaurant and will not return in the future.",1-star
"Even a very enthusiastic wait staff can't make up for mediocre food and a discombobulated kitchen. Zen tries to hard to specialize in too many different cuisines and excels at none of them. Thai soups are bland, pad thai while plentiful lacks authentic taste. Chicken wings ... wait -- what the hell are fried chicken wings doing in a Pan Asian craft cocktail bar. Sushi was nothing special and definitely overpriced. In fact, everything was very overpriced for what you get. While Zen could appease multiple palates if no one in your party can agree on what to eat for dinner, the fact that nothing is overwhelmingly exceptional dominates over everything else. If you want Thai, there are great Thai places in N. Scottsdale - one right across the parking lot from Zen. If you want great sushi, there are plenty of options close by. If you want steak and fish, the same holds true. If you want chicken wings and burgers, there are several sports bars close by. If Zen is going to survive in the very competitive restaurant market in N. Scottsdale, particularly at their price point, they will need to do a major menu overhaul and limit themselves to one or two genres which they really master. If they don't, keep an eye out for a sale of restaurant furniture and fixtures in the place that Zen Culinary used to be.",2-star
"David H. said it perfectly, but after my first trip there, I'd just like to say it myself. I was stunned by the building as I saw it and walked in. Beautifully built and decorated to say the least, and I wasn't ready for that. From front to back, it's nothing but the best you can get. Even the outdoor patios are like no other. You get a feeling of beauty and relaxation with everything you see here. Now, the food. I've been making and eating Thai food for over twenty years, so I know what's out there and have tried it all just about everywhere. The best I've had in Arizona and rivals what you would get in a fine hotel dining room in the best restaurant in Thailand. I was so happy that somebody finally had a chef that could turn out such great Thai dishes. Our food was five stars. The owner, the servers, the place, etc. as well. This is a lesson on how to run a restaurant and make people feel welcome. Period. Easily five stars.",5-star
"I absolutely love Zen Culinary!!!! What an awesome place. I have ate here several times and will continue to come back. Let's start off with the decor. The inside is beautiful and the buildout of the restaurant was done with class all the way. I have sat at the bar and the booths and one thing I can appreciate is the comfort when enjoying my meal. In my opinion it is key to have good seating and they got it right. The 3 projection screens at the bar is very nice and I can watch it from afar as well. The piano and love music is a nice touch and must go see. Seriously thru go live music daily which is fantastic and fun for something different. The patio has been very nice and good for large groups or to just enjoy the cool weather. Let's get up on the food. I have had the panang curry twice with a level 3 spicy which is there hottest and it is the perfect amount of heat. I have had sushi, the chicken satay with the cucumber chutney wow that stuff is awesome and they have a huge full bar with pretty much any drink you can imagine. When I go I always hear people talking about how great the food is and I need to start trying new things and I will. The prices during lunch and happy hour are more than reasonable. Dinner prices are great for dates or friends. The owner and staff are very friendly. I've never experienced anything but great service here and that is another reason to return. I like new, fresh, and modern places and Zen got it. I will be back and trying new things.",5-star
"Zen Culinary is the new hot joint in my area. I have to say that I do love this place! Despite this place is new, it seems like the owners have experience in the art of dining. For an appetizer we ordered the Dragon Balls, which I would recommend and will make sure to get next time I come here. I had the chicken curry which was just delicious and very full of flavor. It was a huge bowl that came piping hot with veggies and big pieces of chicken. My boyfriend had the Zen Steak sandwich which was pretty big and full of flavor as well. As for drinks, I'm not sure I had the best experience. I ordered an Aviation cocktail, which was about a buck or so above what I feel the drink should've been priced at. It was a very, very strong cocktail. Although not my favorite, my waiter asked me if I was sure I liked it and offered to replace it, but I kept it and drank the whole thing. I'm sure other cocktails here are great, so I will make sure to keep trying this place out. The ambiance is very cool. Dark lit and upbeat music with interesting furniture. The outdoor patio look very zen. Staff and waiters are friendly, waters topped off regularly. Overall, Zen Culinary is off to a great start in my opinion, and i hope it sticks around as it's got great potential to become a neighborhood favorite!",5-star
"Saw mixed reviews but wanted to try this place with the family since we love Asian food. The decor/ambiance was really nice and the servers were great. But, this could not not make up for sub-par and overpriced food. We had early dinner (as usual since we have a six year old) and were happy to see a happy hour menu. The chicken satay was great; my son ate two orders. The happy hour sushi roll was tasty but certainly no deal - there were four thin slices for $7. Seems that happy hour sushi means half an order for half the price - not happy. We were told the soups and curries are very large and served family style - so we ordered the yellow curry with chicken and noodle soup with chicken. Both dishes had little chicken and the chicken was flavorless and a strange consistency - found some of the chicken in the curry was not fully cooked - sent that back. The soup was just a lot of noodles and broth with the chicken - not what I was expecting. Both of those dishes were very bland - strange for place with 'culinary' in its name. While they were in large dishes, there was little in the way of meat and vegetables for the price and ""family style"" description - maybe enough for one person. Also, they were awkwardly served - without appropriate dishes and utensils for sharing - messy. So, by this time, we really wanted to leave - but I hardly ate anything. So, I called up Thai House across the parking lot and ordered a chicken curry to bring home - that was really good and knocked the socks off of this food. Zen is probably a good place to go for drinks and a great bar atmosphere, but the food offerings fall short and and are overpriced - there are many other better options close by.",1-star
Very good food with an excellent atmosphere. Everything we ordered was delicious and they even have kid sushi for the kids.,4-star
"Food was great and authentic! We were there on a weeknight and the serving staff was unattentive.... no spoon or bowl with soup, and all food came out at the same time and crammed on the table. All attention was paid to another group (appeared to be known by the manager or something) and we were all but ignored. Too bad because the food was GREAT... Curry and soup AND the fresh sashimi!",2-star
Pineapple fried rice. That's all you need to know. My life is forever changed. I live around the corner from this spot so this could be dangerous.,5-star
This place was awesome! I thought it was a hole in the wall until we walked in. It has plenty of seating and even a banquet room for private parties. They had unique bibimbop options which included a yummy kochujang sauce. We had the ribs which are marinated in a combo kalbi and traditional BBQ sauce. The avocado made the poke amazing. We also had the shrimp shumai which was perfect. The ambience is nice and the bar was huge. The service was exceptional. We will be returning. So glad you're here and close.,5-star
"There are so many great places to eat in Scottsdale and this is not one of them. The staff was awkward and the food was very bland. Not what we were expecting from a place with ""culinary"" in the name.",1-star
"Great foods, great service, and nice presentation. I had the curry custard and it was very yummy. I was hoping to bring the coconut home but that didn't happen. Would b nice to keep my leftovers in the coconut (w a branded logo), what a great way to advertise their restaurant?",5-star
"Fresh and tasty new dishes, really friendly staff. Super cool design and flow, great atmosphere and menu! Will def be back, lots of authentic but new school asian dishes.",5-star
"We came here on a Friday night Dec 2. Didn't realize it until I read other reviews that today was their grand opening. Walking up to the Zen, the patio tables looking very enticing but cold outside. As you walk in the front door is a nice little waterfall. Nice touch. Anyways, they have a huge dining area. Bar area with lots of seating and a dining area. Very bright with red and orange. Very well decorated, wide open feeling with a somewhat touch of Asian. Bar area has three large tv's with large windows where you can see the kitchen. Anyways, we dined in the dining area with the booths. We were greeted right away with our water cups. We started off with the Tuna Mango Poke. It had a whole avocado cut in half with Tuna Poke and Mango. Very well presented. It was good but lacked a little flavor. I had the Pad Thai with beef. It had on the side, peanuts and dry peppers to spice it up. I thought it was pretty good. Not too sweet. For those of you that like your really spicy Thai food, probably wouldn't be spicy enough for you but I really liked it. Decent portion. My wife had the Noodle soup with chicken. She really likes it and I was able to sneak a few bites and it was pretty good. The noodles were good and the soup was really good for a chilly night. My son had the baby back ribs. He liked it. The sauce had a little Asian flare to it with crispy fries. He ate it all up so it must have been pretty good. Service was pretty good. He was always checking on us and made sure our water cups were filled. So Zen had pretty good food, good service, and a pretty unique ambiance about this place. I will tell you what, this place has Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, and American food in a unique setting. Now if you want original Asian food then this place isn't for you. Keep an open mind and just enjoy. I know they have some kinks but I'm sure they will fix them. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying other dishes on the menu. Enjoy. I sure did.",4-star
